"Title: Charting the Landscape of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking: Post-Discovery Refinements in Higgs Phenomenology

Author: Dr. Anya Sharma, Institute for Theoretical Physics, Geneva

Abstract: The discovery of a Higgs-like boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 marked a pivotal moment in particle physics, confirming a crucial element of the Standard Model (SM). This paper delves into the subsequent decade of research focused on refining our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the role played by the Higgs boson. We present a comprehensive review of precision measurements of the Higgs boson's mass, spin, and parity, alongside its couplings to other SM particles, specifically focusing on deviations from SM predictions that could indicate new physics. We explore the evolving landscape of theoretical models beyond the SM that incorporate the Higgs boson, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs scenarios, assessing their viability in light of current experimental constraints. Furthermore, we address the persistent open questions regarding the Higgs potential, the stability of the electroweak vacuum, and the hierarchy problem, highlighting future directions for both theoretical and experimental investigations aimed at unraveling the deeper mysteries surrounding the Higgs boson and its implications for the fundamental laws of nature. This paper aims to provide a consolidated overview of the field, serving as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate the complexities of Higgs phenomenology in the post-discovery era.

1. Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has served as a remarkably successful framework for describing the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. However, the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), which endows elementary particles with mass, remained a significant puzzle until the discovery of a Higgs-like boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This discovery, based on observations of its decay into various final states like photons, Z bosons, and W bosons, provided strong evidence for the existence of a scalar particle predicted by the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. While the initial measurements confirmed the particle's mass to be around 125 GeV and indicated spin-0 and positive parity, consistent with the SM Higgs boson, many questions remained unanswered. The subsequent decade has been marked by intensive efforts to precisely measure the Higgs boson's properties, explore its couplings to other particles, and search for deviations from the SM predictions that could point to new physics beyond the SM. This research has not only confirmed the Higgs boson's role as a key player in EWSB but has also highlighted the limitations of the SM and motivated the development of numerous theoretical extensions that attempt to address its shortcomings.

2. Precision Measurements of Higgs Boson Properties

Following the discovery, a significant effort was dedicated to precisely measuring the Higgs boson's fundamental properties, including its mass, spin, parity, and decay widths. The mass of the Higgs boson has been determined with remarkable precision through combined measurements from the ATLAS and CMS experiments, utilizing various decay channels. These measurements have not only confirmed the consistency of the Higgs mass across different decay modes but have also provided crucial input for theoretical calculations aimed at understanding the stability of the electroweak vacuum. The spin and parity of the Higgs boson were also thoroughly investigated, with experimental data strongly favoring a spin-0, positive parity (CP-even) state, in accordance with the SM predictions. The decay widths of the Higgs boson into different SM particles, such as photons, Z bosons, W bosons, bottom quarks, tau leptons, and top quarks, have been measured with increasing precision. These measurements allow for the determination of the Higgs boson's couplings to these particles, providing a crucial test of the SM. Any significant deviation from the SM predicted couplings would serve as a compelling indication of new physics influencing the Higgs sector.

3. Exploring Higgs Couplings and Beyond the Standard Model

The strength of the Higgs boson's interactions with other particles, its couplings, are directly proportional to their masses in the Standard Model. This relationship is fundamental to the Higgs mechanism and the generation of mass. Experimentally verifying this proportionality has been a major focus of research at the LHC. Measurements of the Higgs boson's couplings to fermions, particularly heavy quarks like the top and bottom quarks, and leptons like the tau, are crucial for confirming the SM's mass generation mechanism. Any significant deviation from the predicted coupling strengths could indicate the presence of new particles that mix with the Higgs boson or modify its interactions. The absence of direct evidence for such particles has led to the development of more sophisticated theoretical models that can accommodate subtle deviations in the Higgs couplings while remaining consistent with experimental constraints. Such models often invoke new physics at higher energy scales, which manifest themselves as effective operators in the low-energy theory, modifying the Higgs couplings in a predictable way. The ongoing and future searches for rare Higgs decays, such as the decay into a Z boson and a photon, are also important for probing new physics that could contribute to these loop-induced processes. These searches provide a complementary approach to directly measuring the Higgs couplings and offer the potential to uncover subtle deviations from the SM predictions.

4. Theoretical Models and Future Directions

The SM, while successful, leaves several fundamental questions unanswered. These include the hierarchy problem, the origin of neutrino masses, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Higgs boson, as a fundamental scalar particle, is particularly susceptible to quantum corrections that can destabilize its mass, leading to the hierarchy problem. Several theoretical models have been proposed to address these issues, often involving new particles and interactions that modify the Higgs sector. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most well-studied extensions of the SM, predicting a symmetry between bosons and fermions, which can stabilize the Higgs mass and provide candidates for dark matter. Composite Higgs models propose that the Higgs boson is not a fundamental particle but rather a bound state of other particles, similar to the pions in QCD. Extra-dimensional models introduce additional spatial dimensions, which can alter the gravitational force and potentially solve the hierarchy problem. The current experimental data from the LHC has placed significant constraints on these models, ruling out many of the simplest versions. However, more sophisticated versions of these models, which can evade these constraints, are still viable and continue to be actively studied. Future directions for both theoretical and experimental research include exploring higher-energy colliders, such as a future circular collider (FCC), which could probe the Higgs sector with unprecedented precision and potentially discover new particles associated with EWSB. Furthermore, advances in detector technology and data analysis techniques will allow for more sensitive searches for rare Higgs decays and subtle deviations in the Higgs couplings, providing a more comprehensive picture of the Higgs boson and its role in the fundamental laws of nature.",Other
"Chat is a bad UI pattern for development tools
Code forces humans to be precise. That’s good—computers need precision. But it also forces humans to think like machines.

For decades we tried to fix this by making programming more human-friendly. Higher-level languages. Visual interfaces. Each step helped, but we were still translating human thoughts into computer instructions.

AI was supposed to change everything. Finally, plain English could be a programming language—one everyone already knows. No syntax. No rules. Just say what you want.

The first wave of AI coding tools squandered this opportunity. They make flashy demos but produce garbage software. People call them “great for prototyping,” which means “don’t use this for anything real.”

Many blame the AI models, saying we just need them to get smarter. This is wrong. Yes, better AI will make better guesses about what you mean. But when you’re building serious software, you don’t want guesses—even smart ones. You want to know exactly what you’re building.

Current AI tools pretend writing software is like having a conversation. It’s not. It’s like writing laws. You’re using English, but you’re defining terms, establishing rules, and managing complex interactions between everything you’ve said.

Try writing a tax code in chat messages. You can’t. Even simple tax codes are too complex to keep in your head. That’s why we use documents—they let us organize complexity, reference specific points, and track changes systematically. Chat reduces you to memory and hope.

This is the core problem. You can’t build real software without being precise about what you want. Every successful programming tool in history reflects this truth. AI briefly fooled us into thinking we could just chat our way to working software.

We can’t. You don’t program by chatting. You program by writing documents.

When your intent is in a document instead of scattered across a chat log, English becomes a real programming language:

You can see your whole system at once
You can clarify and improve your intent
You can track changes properly
Teams can work on the system together
Requirements become their own quality checks
Changes start from clear specifications
The first company to get this will own the next phase of AI development tools. They’ll build tools for real software instead of toys. They’ll make everything available today look like primitive experiments.",Other

How I use LLMs as a staff
engineer
Software engineers are deeply split on the subject of large language models. Many
believe they’re the most transformative technology to ever hit the industry. Others believe
they’re the latest in a long line of hype-only products: exciting to think about, but
ultimately not useful to professionals trying to do serious work.
Personally, I feel like I get a lot of value from AI. I think many of the people who don’t feel
this way are “holding it wrong”: i.e. they’re not using language models in the most helpful
ways. In this post, I’m going to list a bunch of ways I regularly use AI in my day-to-day as
a staff engineer.
Writing production code
I use Copilot completions every time I write code . Almost all the completions I accept
are complete boilerplate (filling out function arguments or types, for instance). It’s rare
that I let Copilot produce business logic for me, but it does occasionally happen. In my
areas of expertise (Ruby on Rails, for instance), I’m confident I can do better work than
the LLM. It’s just a (very good) autocomplete.
However, I’m not always working in my areas of expertise. I frequently find myself
making small tactical changes in less-familiar areas (for instance, a Golang service or a
C library). I know the syntax and have written personal projects in these languages, but
I’m less confident about what’s idiomatic. In these cases, I rely on Copilot more. Typically
I’ll use Copilot chat with the o1 model enabled, paste in my code, and ask directly “is this
idiomatic C?”
Relying more on the LLM like this is risky, because I don’t know what I’m missing. It
basically lets me operate at a smart-intern baseline across the board. I have to also
behave like a sensible intern, and make sure a subject-matter expert in the area reviews
the change for me. But even with that caveat, I think it’s very high-leverage to be able to
make these kinds of tactical changes quickly.

Writing throwaway code
I am much more liberal with my use of LLMs when I’m writing code that will never see
production. For instance, I recently did a block of research which required pulling chunks
of public data from an API, classifying it, and approximating that classification with a
series of quick regexes. All of this code was run on my laptop only, and I used LLMs to
write basically all of it: the code to pull the data, the code to run a separate LLM to
classify it, the code to tokenize it and measure token frequencies and score them, and so
on.
LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-
production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say
that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted.
Learning new domains
Probably the most useful thing I do with LLMs is use it as a tutor-on-demand for learning
new domains. For instance, last weekend I learned the basics of Unity, relying heavily on
ChatGPT-4o. The magic of learning with LLMs is that you can ask questions: not just
“how does X work”, but follow-up questions like “how does X relate to Y”. Even more
usefully, you can ask “is this right” questions. I often write up something I think I’ve
learned and feed it back to the LLM, which points out where I’m right and where I’m still
misunderstanding. I ask the LLM a lot of questions.
I take a lot of notes when I’m learning something new. Being able to just copy-paste all
my notes in and get them reviewed by the LLM is great.
What about hallucinations? Honestly, since GPT-3.5, I haven’t noticed ChatGPT or
Claude doing a lot of hallucinating. Most of the areas I’m trying to learn about are very
well-understood (just not by me), and in my experience that means the chance of a
hallucination is pretty low. I’ve never run into a case where I learned something from a
LLM that turned out to be fundamentally wrong or hallucinated.
Last resort bug fixes
I don’t do this a lot, but sometimes when I’m really stuck on a bug, I’ll attach the entire
file or files to Copilot chat, paste the error message, and just ask “can you help?”

The reason I don’t do this is that I think I’m currently much better at bug-hunting than
current AI models. Almost all the time, Copilot (or Claude, for some personal projects)
just gets confused. But it’s still worth a try if I’m genuinely stuck, just in case, because it’s
so low-effort. I remember two or three cases where I’d just missed some subtle
behaviour that the LLM caught, saving me a lot of time.
Because LLMs aren’t that good at this yet, I don’t spend a lot of time iterating or trying to
un-stick the LLM. I just try once to see if it can get it.
Proofreading for typos and logic mistakes
I write a fair amount of English documents: ADRs, technical summaries, internal posts,
and so on. I never allow the LLM to write these for me. Part of that is that I think I can
write more clearly than current LLMs. Part of it is my general distaste for the ChatGPT
house style.
What I do occasionally do is feed a draft into the LLM and ask for feedback. LLMs are
great at catching typos, and will sometimes raise an interesting point that becomes an
edit to my draft.
Like bugfixing, I don’t iterate when I’m doing this - I just ask for one round of feedback.
Usually the LLM offers some stylistic feedback, which I always ignore.
Summary
I use LLMs for these tasks:
Smart autocomplete with Copilot
Short tactical changes in areas I don’t know well (always reviewed by a SME)
Writing lots of use-once-and-throwaway research code
Asking lots of questions to learn about new topics (e.g. the Unity game engine)
Last-resort bugfixes, just in case it can figure it out immediately
Big-picture proofreading for long-form English communication
I don’t use LLMs for these tasks (yet):

Writing whole PRs for me in areas I’m familiar with
Writing ADRs or other technical communications
Research in large codebases and finding out how things are done

"How I use LLMs as a staff
 engineer
 Software engineers are deeply split on the subject of large language models. Many
 believe they’re the most transformative technology to ever hit the industry. Others believe
 they’re the latest in a long line of hype-only products: exciting to think about, but
 ultimately not useful to professionals trying to do serious work.
 Personally, I feel like I get a lot of value from AI. I think many of the people who don’t feel
 this way are “holding it wrong”: i.e. they’re not using language models in the most helpful
 ways. In this post, I’m going to list a bunch of ways I regularly use AI in my day-to-day as
 a staff engineer.
 Writing production code
 1
 I use Copilot completions every time I write code . Almost all the completions I accept
 are complete boilerplate (filling out function arguments or types, for instance). It’s rare
 that I let Copilot produce business logic for me, but it does occasionally happen. In my
 areas of expertise (Ruby on Rails, for instance), I’m confident I can do better work than
 the LLM. It’s just a (very good) autocomplete.
 However, I’m not always working in my areas of expertise. I frequently find myself
 making small tactical changes in less-familiar areas (for instance, a Golang service or a
 C library). I know the syntax and have written personal projects in these languages, but
 I’m less confident about what’s idiomatic. In these cases, I rely on Copilot more. Typically

"Proposal for the Implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Enhanced Data Governance and Collaborative Research in Genomic Sequencing

This document serves as a multi-faceted communication, addressing technical specifications, business justifications, legal considerations, academic relevance, and general public accessibility concerning the proposed implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) within the sphere of genomic sequencing. We posit that a DAO-based framework offers a superior model for data governance, collaborative research, and equitable benefit sharing compared to existing centralized systems. The core of our argument rests on the inherent transparency, immutability, and democratic nature of blockchain technology, which underpins the DAO structure. This proposal outlines the technical architecture, operational protocols, and anticipated benefits of such a system, while also addressing potential legal ramifications and ethical considerations related to data privacy and intellectual property. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the academic rigor of this approach, citing relevant literature on blockchain governance, genomic data management, and collaborative research methodologies. Finally, we will communicate this complex topic in a manner accessible to a general audience, highlighting the potential societal impact of democratized genomic research and the ethical imperative of responsible data stewardship.

The current landscape of genomic research is characterized by fragmented data silos, restricted access, and concerns over data security and privacy. Centralized databases, while offering some level of control, are vulnerable to single points of failure, data breaches, and biased decision-making. Moreover, the lack of transparency in data usage and benefit sharing hinders collaboration and impedes scientific progress. A DAO, conversely, offers a decentralized and transparent alternative. The proposed DAO will operate on a permissioned blockchain, ensuring data integrity and access control. Participants, including researchers, patients, and data providers, will be granted membership tokens, affording them voting rights on key decisions, such as data access requests, research priorities, and allocation of funding. Smart contracts will automate the execution of these decisions, ensuring impartiality and accountability. Technically, the system will leverage secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and differential privacy techniques to protect sensitive genomic data while still enabling valuable insights. This will be architected around a modular system using existing open-source tools where feasible, with custom smart contracts built using Solidity and formally verified to minimise attack surfaces. We believe this technical architecture offers a robust and scalable solution for managing the complexities of genomic data.

From a business perspective, the DAO presents a compelling model for incentivizing data sharing and accelerating scientific discovery. By creating a tokenized ecosystem, data providers can be rewarded for contributing valuable genomic information, fostering a more collaborative and inclusive research environment. Pharmaceutical companies and research institutions can leverage the DAO's data resources to develop new diagnostic tools, personalized therapies, and preventative strategies, potentially unlocking significant economic value. The increased transparency and efficiency of the DAO can also reduce administrative overhead and streamline research workflows, leading to cost savings and faster innovation cycles. A detailed financial model, including projected revenue streams, operational expenses, and potential return on investment, is included in the appendix. Furthermore, the DAO's decentralized governance structure can attract funding from a wider range of sources, including philanthropic organizations, venture capital firms, and government agencies, all aligned with the principles of open science and equitable access.

Legally, the establishment and operation of a genomic data DAO require careful consideration of existing regulations, including data privacy laws such as GDPR and HIPAA, as well as intellectual property rights. The smart contracts governing the DAO will be designed to ensure compliance with these legal frameworks, incorporating mechanisms for data anonymization, consent management, and secure data transfer. A legal opinion from a qualified expert in blockchain law and genomic data regulation has been commissioned to assess the potential legal risks and liabilities associated with the DAO. The DAO's legal structure will also need to address the issue of liability in the event of data breaches or other unforeseen events. A comprehensive legal framework, including terms of service, data usage agreements, and dispute resolution mechanisms, will be developed to mitigate these risks and protect the interests of all participants. This legal framework will be an evolving document, adapting to regulatory changes and emerging legal precedents.

Academically, the implementation of a genomic data DAO aligns with the growing body of research on blockchain governance, data science, and collaborative research methodologies. We cite existing literature that highlights the potential of DAOs to improve transparency, accountability, and efficiency in various domains. Our proposed DAO builds upon these prior studies, applying the DAO framework to the specific challenges and opportunities of genomic research. We believe that the DAO will serve as a valuable case study for researchers interested in exploring the applications of blockchain technology in healthcare and scientific research. Furthermore, the DAO will generate valuable data and insights that can be used to improve the design and implementation of future decentralized systems.

In conclusion, the proposed genomic data DAO offers a compelling vision for the future of genomic research. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more transparent, collaborative, and equitable ecosystem for data governance and scientific discovery. This DAO will be a valuable resource for researchers, patients, and the broader community, accelerating the development of new therapies and improving human health. We encourage all stakeholders to consider the potential of this transformative technology and to join us in building a more decentralized and democratic future for genomic research.",Business Proposal

"Python, a versatile and widely-used high-level programming language, has become a staple in various domains ranging from web development and data science to scripting and automation. Its appeal stems from its clear syntax, which emphasizes readability, making it easier to learn and maintain code. The language employs dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable, allowing for faster development cycles. Python is also interpreted, executing code line by line rather than requiring compilation into machine code beforehand. This facilitates rapid prototyping and testing. Furthermore, Python boasts an extensive standard library brimming with modules for common tasks like file handling, networking, and operating system interaction. This rich library significantly reduces the need to write code from scratch, accelerating development and promoting code reuse.

Beyond its core features, the real power of Python lies in its vast ecosystem of third-party packages and libraries. These packages, easily installable using the pip package manager, extend Python's functionality into specialized areas. NumPy and Pandas are essential for numerical computing and data analysis, providing powerful data structures and analysis tools. Libraries like Scikit-learn provide a suite of machine learning algorithms, while TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular frameworks for deep learning. Django and Flask are used for building web applications, offering different levels of control and complexity. This extensive collection of readily available tools makes Python a go-to language for solving a wide range of problems efficiently and effectively. Whether you're building a complex web application, analyzing large datasets, or automating simple tasks, Python offers the tools and flexibility to get the job done.

The core syntax of Python emphasizes readability through the use of indentation to define code blocks. This enforces a consistent code style and makes it easier to understand the structure of a program. Python supports various programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming, giving developers the freedom to choose the approach that best suits their needs. Objects are a fundamental part of Python, and everything in Python is an object, including numbers, strings, and even functions. This object-oriented nature allows for code organization and reusability through classes and inheritance. Python also includes powerful features like list comprehensions, generators, and decorators, which enable concise and expressive code. Furthermore, Python's exception handling mechanism allows for robust error handling, ensuring that programs can gracefully recover from unexpected situations.",Other

"Why Is This C.E.O. Bragging About Replacing Humans With A.I.?
Noam Scheiber
Ask typical corporate executives about their goals in adopting artificial intelligence, and they will most likely make vague pronouncements about how the technology will help employees enjoy more satisfying careers, or create as many opportunities as it eliminates. A.I. will “help tackle the kind of tasks most people find repetitive, which frees up employees to take on higher-value work,” Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, wrote in 2023.
And then there’s Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna, a Swedish tech firm that helps consumers defer payment on purchases and that has filed paperwork to go public in the United States with an expected valuation north of $15 billion.

Over the past year, Klarna and Mr. Siemiatkowski have repeatedly talked up the amount of work they have automated using generative A.I., which serves up text, images and videos that look like they were created by people. “I am of the opinion that A.I. can already do all of the jobs that we, as humans, do,” he told Bloomberg News, a view that goes far beyond what most experts claim.
According to Klarna, the company has saved the equivalent of $10 million annually using A.I. for its marketing needs, partly by reducing its reliance on human artists to generate images for advertising. The company said that using A.I. tools had cut back on the time that its in-house lawyers spend generating standard contracts — to about 10 minutes from an hour — and that its communications staff uses the technology to classify press coverage as positive or negative. Klarna has said that the company’s chatbot does the work of 700 customer service agents and that the bot resolves cases an average of nine minutes faster than humans (under two minutes versus 11).
Mr. Siemiatkowski and his team went so far as to rig up an A.I. version of him to announce the company’s third-quarter results last year — to show that even the C.E.O.’s job isn’t safe from automation.
In interviews, Mr. Siemiatkowski has made clear he doesn’t believe the technology will simply free up workers to focus on more interesting tasks. “People say, ‘Oh, don’t worry, there’s going to be new jobs,’” he said on a podcast last summer, before citing the thousands of professional translators whom A.I. is rapidly making superfluous. “I don’t think it’s easy to say to a 55-year-old translator, ‘Don’t worry, you’re going to become a YouTube influencer.’”
Mr. Krishna, the IBM chief executive, once turned heads when he said A.I. could prompt the company to slow or pause hiring for the roughly 10 percent of its jobs involving back-office roles like human resources.

For his part, Mr. Siemiatkowski said that A.I. had allowed his company to largely stop hiring entirely as of September 2023, which he said reduced its overall head count to under 4,000 from about 5,000. He said he expected Klarna’s work force to eventually fall to about 2,000 as a result of its A.I. adoption. (Mr. Siemiatkowski and Klarna declined to comment for this article.)

One might be tempted to conclude that Mr. Siemiatkowski is simply unfamiliar with the political sensitivity around questions of automation, or with the best practices for communicating about it to skeptical employees. (“Leaders can combat this initial resistance by highlighting how A.I. can help people focus on more meaningful work,” an IBM study said.)
But Mr. Siemiatkowski is well aware of the backlash that his bluntness can provoke. “We did a tweet later on about the marketing things we are doing about A.I., where we have less need for photographers,” he said in the podcast interview. “That had a violent reaction online.”
Instead, interviews with former employees and transcripts of internal company meetings suggest that Mr. Siemiatkowski’s pronouncements about A.I. are motivated by something altogether different from political naïveté or an impulse for real talk. And those motivations shed light on the A.I. future that many executives and investors are working to bring about.
Leaning In to Automation
So far, most large companies do not appear to be replacing workers en masse. A report on 50 large banks by Evident, a firm that analyzes A.I. adoption, found that they typically derive other benefits from the technology, like improving services or helping employees work faster.
In a paper exploring one area that Klarna has highlighted, customer service, the Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson and two co-authors found that A.I. made many employees more productive when it came to relatively complicated tasks, like navigating customers’ tax issues.
The bot did this by excelling at certain simpler tasks, like advising the human on the optimal order in which to request information from a customer. But it didn’t handle the interaction from start to finish. (In fairness, the experiment didn’t attempt full automation.) “I think people exaggerate how much they can automate everything in the near term,” said Dr. Brynjolfsson, though he acknowledged that more tasks could be automated as A.I. became more powerful over the next few years.
When pressed, Mr. Siemiatkowski has conceded that the picture is somewhat more complicated than his company’s news releases have suggested. He explained on another podcast that Klarna had been relying on humans to perform customer service tasks that other companies had automated long before A.I., like instructing a customer where to go on the Klarna app to delay a payment. As a result, Klarna replaced more workers than other companies would have replaced.
His claims about hiring may have been overblown, too. The website TechCrunch searched through Klarna’s job listings more than a year after the company supposedly stopped hiring and found more than 50 openings in a variety of jobs. A Klarna spokesman told the outlet that the company was “not actively recruiting to expand the work force but only backfilling some essential roles” like engineering, and that Mr. Siemiatkowski had been “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.”
But all of this raises the question: At a moment when A.I. is already alarming office workers, why would a chief executive not only speak candidly about his company’s progress in automating jobs, but even overstate the case?
A Self-Mythologizing Rise
The son of Polish nationals who immigrated to Sweden in the early 1980s, not long before he was born, Mr. Siemiatkowski grew up feeling like something of an outsider in his parents’ adopted country. He has talked of being teased as a child. According to former employees, he once said that feeling like an outsider helped him empathize with Black Americans after the killing of George Floyd.
Mr. Siemiatkowski founded Klarna, then known as Kreditor, in 2005 with two classmates after a telemarketing job alerted him to the problems that small companies had collecting payments from online customers. The idea was to guarantee the payment for merchants and collect from the customer later.
It was an old retail practice known as “buy now, pay later,” except updated for the internet age.
The company quickly turned a profit by charging merchants a fee for the payment service, and began expanding across Europe and taking business from banks. By 2010, Klarna had renamed itself Klarna, meaning “clear,” and had begun to attract the attention of Silicon Valley investors.

Mr. Siemiatkowski gave the impression of someone who had for years been playing out the moment in his mind. When the famed Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia dispatched a partner to Sweden to pitch the co-founders on an investment, telling them Sequoia thought they could transform banking the way Google had changed the internet, Mr. Siemiatkowski was quick to pipe up. “Just tell me one more thing,” he said, recalling the exchange to Forbes magazine years later. “If we’re going to be the Google of banks, would you really just send you? Wouldn’t the whole of Sequoia come here?”
The Sequoia partner quickly connected the founders with Michael Moritz, one of the firm’s high-profile investors. Mr. Moritz apologized for not appearing in person and later joined Klarna’s board.
Mr. Siemiatkowski, who with his strong jaw and blue eyes looks like a long-lost Hemsworth brother, seemed to style himself as the kind of tech mogul investors were eager to back. Former employees said the company’s hiring process for engineers resembled that of a Silicon Valley start-up — using a logic test to screen applicants, then requiring some to demonstrate their coding chops in real time. From Amazon, he borrowed the “two pizza” rule — keeping teams small enough that the group could be fed with two pizzas.
In 2019, Klarna began to build a major presence in the United States. The company’s timing proved impeccable. When the pandemic hit, Americans cut back on dining out and travel and embarked on an online shopping splurge — precisely the consumption habits Klarna was built to enable.
New investors piled in at ever-higher valuations — from $5.5 billion in 2019 to $45.6 billion in 2021. Klarna accelerated hiring, roughly tripling in size to 7,000 employees within three years. It ran a Super Bowl ad starring Maya Rudolph to lodge itself in the American psyche.
Then the bill came due. From Google to Amazon to Netflix, the share prices of companies that had raked in profits as people retreated to their living rooms were suddenly pummeled by investors who saw rising inflation and interest rates as a sign that the pandemic-era boom was ending.
When Klarna tried to raise money again in 2022, reportedly seeking a valuation above $50 billion, investors had other ideas. A funding round announced in July would value it at a mere $6.7 billion.
In the meantime, Klarna culled about 10 percent of its employees, under pressure from investors to cut costs, and endured suddenly skeptical media coverage.
Mr. Siemiatkowski also now had to contend with another setback to his rise as a tech icon: a growing union presence inside the company.
Though morale at Klarna had generally been high because of its collaborative culture and competitive pay, a relatively small group of workers had formed a union in 2020. The union roughly doubled in size, to over 1,000 employees, not long after the downsizing announcement in May 2022.
During an all-hands meeting around the same time, a recording of which The New York Times obtained, Mr. Siemiatkowski spoke darkly of how unionized companies handle layoffs (“union representatives and senior management, behind locked doors, decide on the outcome of each individual”).
He seemed to worry that a union would turn Klarna into just another stodgy Swedish company — around 90 percent of the country’s workers are covered by collective-bargaining agreements — and hardly the muse of investors worldwide. “The more everything becomes thick and slow moving,” he said at another meeting, alluding to the effect of a union, “my investors will challenge me.”
But as workers prepared to strike in the fall of 2023, the company backed down and signed a collective-bargaining agreement.
Mr. Siemiatkowski was sarcastic and brooding as he announced the arrangement at a third all-hands meeting. He appeared to liken union leaders to the pigs in “Animal Farm,” whom George Orwell had intended as a stand-in for Stalinists, and he quipped that there were two people in the entire company of more than 4,000 who made less than what the collective-bargaining agreement would mandate. “They’re going to get a salary increase thanks to us signing the C.B.A.,” he said. “Isn’t that amazing?”
A Favorite Guinea Pig
Mr. Siemiatkowski often says he first realized A.I. would upend the workaday world shortly after playing around with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, only a few months after Klarna endured layoffs and saw its valuation crater. “I’m on Twitter in November ’22, and somebody is tweeting, ‘You’ve got to try this,’” he said on a podcast. “I’m just like, ‘Jesus, I’m speaking to a computer.’”
He quickly arranged a meeting with Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, and began pushing employees to experiment with the software.

Whatever progress Klarna made on automation, Mr. Siemiatkowski sometimes seemed as invested in spinning out a story about A.I. as actually using the technology. In 2024, he and the company regularly put out news releases and conducted interviews, leading to headlines like “Klarna Marketing Chief Says A.I. Is Helping It Become ‘Brutally Efficient,’” in The Wall Street Journal.
By the time Mr. Siemiatkowski made the rounds of prominent tech podcasts that summer, in a tour that included the popular show “Acquired” and podcasts hosted by Sequoia and the venture capitalist Logan Bartlett, he seemed to have distilled Klarna’s A.I. story to its sharpest narrative elements.
“My understanding is that you told Sam and OpenAI that you wanted to be their guinea pig,” an interviewer said.
“Their favorite guinea pig,” Mr. Siemiatkowski corrected.
A former Klarna manager, who left in 2022, said the rhetorical emphasis on A.I. was no accident. According to the manager, there was a sense within the company that Klarna had lost its sheen in the media and among investors, and that Mr. Siemiatkowski was desperate to get it back.

The former manager said the A.I. story provided a lifeline at a time when Klarna was hoping to offer shares on the public markets. It demonstrated that the company was still on the cutting edge, and that it was shrinking not because it had faltered but because it had figured out how to replace humans with machines.
The effort appears to have worked. Klarna’s likely public offering is one of the more anticipated of this year and could fetch triple the valuation that followed its 2022 swoon. Though some of that progress reflects Klarna’s improved financial performance over the past year and a half and the upward march of the market overall, Mr. Siemiatkowski’s relentless focus on A.I. appears to have been important. “The benefits of A.I. are likely to be a key selling point for any Klarna I.P.O.,” The Financial Times wrote last year.
It does not appear to have hurt that Mr. Siemiatkowski is willing to go much further in his A.I. pronouncements than fellow C.E.O.s, telling the paper, “Not only can we do more with less, but we can do much more with less.”
Mr. Siemiatkowski’s statements are sometimes sweeping or grandiose because, former employees say, he sees himself as a righteous warrior in a fight with powerful forces. “I have always been anti-establishment,” he said at one all-hands meeting. “To me, what we’ve been doing here, going after the banks, is to be anti-establishment.”
As with his challenge to Swedish banks and his standoff with the union, Mr. Siemiatkowski’s A.I. campaign appears to be another instance of self-interest merging with heroic self-conception.
When the host of the “Big Technology Podcast” asked why he was so intent on talking up Klarna’s A.I. prowess, Mr. Siemiatkowski said it was partly for the good of humanity.
“We have a moral responsibility to share that we are actually seeing real results and that that’s actually having implications on society today,” he said. “To encourage people, specifically politicians in society, to actually treating this as a serious change that’s coming.”
Then he acknowledged that another part of the motivation was “self-promotion, for sure.” He added, “We’re regarded as a thought leader.”
Saying What Investors Can’t
Mr. Siemiatkowski may have at times overstated what A.I. has accomplished at Klarna, but that doesn’t mean he’s wrong about the future.

Dr. Brynjolfsson of Stanford notes that most office jobs are collections of tasks, and that while A.I. can take on some of them, it still struggles to combine most or all of them in the manner of a human.
But even he believes that could change within a few years, while a growing number of tech experts argue that artificial general intelligence — a bot that can do anything the human brain does — is not far-off. Mr. Altman of OpenAI recently predicted that A.I. agents — bots than can perform relatively complicated tasks on their own— would soon “join the work force” and “materially change the output of companies.” Others have predicted that such agents will take over a wide variety of jobs.
Many tech investors are already banking on this outcome, effectively counting on automation to save their huge bets on free-spending A.I companies. In an influential analysis last year, the venture capitalist David Cahn estimated that the combined A.I.-related revenue of companies like OpenAI and Microsoft was likely to be hundreds of billions a year less than the amount needed to pay back investors.
But one way to make the numbers add up is if employers can save hundreds of billions of dollars using A.I. to replace workers in the relatively near future. In that case, the revenue of companies like OpenAI could grow rapidly and their investors could earn a profit. (They might still risk being undercut by Chinese competitors who can build similar technology at lower cost, though that would also make it cheaper for employers to automate work.)
The catch is that very few investors and top executives are willing to discuss this in plain language. When it comes to the question of job loss, those with a large financial interest in A.I. tend to euphemize and equivocate.
Even Mr. Altman, one of the foremost proponents of the idea that A.I. will soon be capable of advanced humanlike cognition, has increasingly avoided discussing the potential downside for workers. Two years ago, he conceded that A.I. would take over certain jobs and that the shift in power from labor to capital “goes way further in a world with A.I.” By last year, he had toned down this language, telling a podcaster that he, too, imagined A.I. taking over tasks rather than whole jobs and that it would allow people to do work at “a higher level of abstraction.” He did this even as — or perhaps because — he seemed to think the technology was becoming vastly more powerful.
(OpenAI declined to comment. The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, for copyright infringement. The two tech companies have denied the claims.)
Mr. Siemiatkowski has brought clarity to this discussion. In his eagerness to court investors, and in his tendency to overstate the case and say the quiet part out loud, he has laid bare Silicon Valley’s ambition. In his own slightly muddled way, for his own slightly idiosyncratic reasons, he is helping to surface a conversation that has largely been whispered in the executive suites.
Investors in his presence sometimes become so excited about the possibilities of displacing humans that they forget to deploy the usual euphemisms and aphorisms. During a podcast interview with Mr. Siemiatkowski, a partner at the prominent venture firm Kleiner Perkins gushed about Klarna’s “full-on automation at scale” and said, “That’s where it’s eyebrow-raising.”
At times, even Mr. Siemiatkowski can be wrong-footed by such directness. When another podcaster asked which jobs were most likely to be automated, he seemed momentarily flustered, then reached for a joke he’d told Sam Altman.
“I said to Sam, ‘What you should focus on, try to build A.I. that replaces C.E.O.s, bankers and lawyers,’” he recalled, identifying three unpopular jobs. “‘Nobody will make a big fuss about it.’”
