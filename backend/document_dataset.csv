"Title: Charting the Landscape of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking: Post-Discovery Refinements in Higgs Phenomenology

Author: Dr. Anya Sharma, Institute for Theoretical Physics, Geneva

Abstract: The discovery of a Higgs-like boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 marked a pivotal moment in particle physics, confirming a crucial element of the Standard Model (SM). This paper delves into the subsequent decade of research focused on refining our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the role played by the Higgs boson. We present a comprehensive review of precision measurements of the Higgs boson's mass, spin, and parity, alongside its couplings to other SM particles, specifically focusing on deviations from SM predictions that could indicate new physics. We explore the evolving landscape of theoretical models beyond the SM that incorporate the Higgs boson, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs scenarios, assessing their viability in light of current experimental constraints. Furthermore, we address the persistent open questions regarding the Higgs potential, the stability of the electroweak vacuum, and the hierarchy problem, highlighting future directions for both theoretical and experimental investigations aimed at unraveling the deeper mysteries surrounding the Higgs boson and its implications for the fundamental laws of nature. This paper aims to provide a consolidated overview of the field, serving as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate the complexities of Higgs phenomenology in the post-discovery era.

1. Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has served as a remarkably successful framework for describing the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. However, the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), which endows elementary particles with mass, remained a significant puzzle until the discovery of a Higgs-like boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This discovery, based on observations of its decay into various final states like photons, Z bosons, and W bosons, provided strong evidence for the existence of a scalar particle predicted by the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. While the initial measurements confirmed the particle's mass to be around 125 GeV and indicated spin-0 and positive parity, consistent with the SM Higgs boson, many questions remained unanswered. The subsequent decade has been marked by intensive efforts to precisely measure the Higgs boson's properties, explore its couplings to other particles, and search for deviations from the SM predictions that could point to new physics beyond the SM. This research has not only confirmed the Higgs boson's role as a key player in EWSB but has also highlighted the limitations of the SM and motivated the development of numerous theoretical extensions that attempt to address its shortcomings.

2. Precision Measurements of Higgs Boson Properties

Following the discovery, a significant effort was dedicated to precisely measuring the Higgs boson's fundamental properties, including its mass, spin, parity, and decay widths. The mass of the Higgs boson has been determined with remarkable precision through combined measurements from the ATLAS and CMS experiments, utilizing various decay channels. These measurements have not only confirmed the consistency of the Higgs mass across different decay modes but have also provided crucial input for theoretical calculations aimed at understanding the stability of the electroweak vacuum. The spin and parity of the Higgs boson were also thoroughly investigated, with experimental data strongly favoring a spin-0, positive parity (CP-even) state, in accordance with the SM predictions. The decay widths of the Higgs boson into different SM particles, such as photons, Z bosons, W bosons, bottom quarks, tau leptons, and top quarks, have been measured with increasing precision. These measurements allow for the determination of the Higgs boson's couplings to these particles, providing a crucial test of the SM. Any significant deviation from the SM predicted couplings would serve as a compelling indication of new physics influencing the Higgs sector.

3. Exploring Higgs Couplings and Beyond the Standard Model

The strength of the Higgs boson's interactions with other particles, its couplings, are directly proportional to their masses in the Standard Model. This relationship is fundamental to the Higgs mechanism and the generation of mass. Experimentally verifying this proportionality has been a major focus of research at the LHC. Measurements of the Higgs boson's couplings to fermions, particularly heavy quarks like the top and bottom quarks, and leptons like the tau, are crucial for confirming the SM's mass generation mechanism. Any significant deviation from the predicted coupling strengths could indicate the presence of new particles that mix with the Higgs boson or modify its interactions. The absence of direct evidence for such particles has led to the development of more sophisticated theoretical models that can accommodate subtle deviations in the Higgs couplings while remaining consistent with experimental constraints. Such models often invoke new physics at higher energy scales, which manifest themselves as effective operators in the low-energy theory, modifying the Higgs couplings in a predictable way. The ongoing and future searches for rare Higgs decays, such as the decay into a Z boson and a photon, are also important for probing new physics that could contribute to these loop-induced processes. These searches provide a complementary approach to directly measuring the Higgs couplings and offer the potential to uncover subtle deviations from the SM predictions.

4. Theoretical Models and Future Directions

The SM, while successful, leaves several fundamental questions unanswered. These include the hierarchy problem, the origin of neutrino masses, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Higgs boson, as a fundamental scalar particle, is particularly susceptible to quantum corrections that can destabilize its mass, leading to the hierarchy problem. Several theoretical models have been proposed to address these issues, often involving new particles and interactions that modify the Higgs sector. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most well-studied extensions of the SM, predicting a symmetry between bosons and fermions, which can stabilize the Higgs mass and provide candidates for dark matter. Composite Higgs models propose that the Higgs boson is not a fundamental particle but rather a bound state of other particles, similar to the pions in QCD. Extra-dimensional models introduce additional spatial dimensions, which can alter the gravitational force and potentially solve the hierarchy problem. The current experimental data from the LHC has placed significant constraints on these models, ruling out many of the simplest versions. However, more sophisticated versions of these models, which can evade these constraints, are still viable and continue to be actively studied. Future directions for both theoretical and experimental research include exploring higher-energy colliders, such as a future circular collider (FCC), which could probe the Higgs sector with unprecedented precision and potentially discover new particles associated with EWSB. Furthermore, advances in detector technology and data analysis techniques will allow for more sensitive searches for rare Higgs decays and subtle deviations in the Higgs couplings, providing a more comprehensive picture of the Higgs boson and its role in the fundamental laws of nature.",Other
"Chat is a bad UI pattern for development tools
Code forces humans to be precise. That’s good—computers need precision. But it also forces humans to think like machines.

For decades we tried to fix this by making programming more human-friendly. Higher-level languages. Visual interfaces. Each step helped, but we were still translating human thoughts into computer instructions.

AI was supposed to change everything. Finally, plain English could be a programming language—one everyone already knows. No syntax. No rules. Just say what you want.

The first wave of AI coding tools squandered this opportunity. They make flashy demos but produce garbage software. People call them “great for prototyping,” which means “don’t use this for anything real.”

Many blame the AI models, saying we just need them to get smarter. This is wrong. Yes, better AI will make better guesses about what you mean. But when you’re building serious software, you don’t want guesses—even smart ones. You want to know exactly what you’re building.

Current AI tools pretend writing software is like having a conversation. It’s not. It’s like writing laws. You’re using English, but you’re defining terms, establishing rules, and managing complex interactions between everything you’ve said.

Try writing a tax code in chat messages. You can’t. Even simple tax codes are too complex to keep in your head. That’s why we use documents—they let us organize complexity, reference specific points, and track changes systematically. Chat reduces you to memory and hope.

This is the core problem. You can’t build real software without being precise about what you want. Every successful programming tool in history reflects this truth. AI briefly fooled us into thinking we could just chat our way to working software.

We can’t. You don’t program by chatting. You program by writing documents.

When your intent is in a document instead of scattered across a chat log, English becomes a real programming language:

You can see your whole system at once
You can clarify and improve your intent
You can track changes properly
Teams can work on the system together
Requirements become their own quality checks
Changes start from clear specifications
The first company to get this will own the next phase of AI development tools. They’ll build tools for real software instead of toys. They’ll make everything available today look like primitive experiments.",Other

The framework provides tools for integrating with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, allowing developers to easily incorporate AI-powered functionalities into their web applications. CompuJAI's API allows for models to be served through REST endpoints, enabling real-time predictions and analysis based on user input. The framework also includes features for managing model versions, monitoring model performance, and deploying updated models with minimal downtime. Furthermore, CompuJAI supports the use of containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to streamline the deployment process and ensure scalability. This allows developers to easily deploy their machine learning models to cloud environments and scale them as needed to handle increasing traffic. The architecture of CompuJAI promotes a modular design, allowing for different machine learning models to be easily swapped in and out without affecting the rest of the application. By providing a comprehensive platform for machine learning integration, CompuJAI empowers developers to build intelligent web applications that can learn and adapt to changing data patterns.

API Design and Development with Python in CompuJAI
Python, with the help of frameworks like Flask and FastAPI, is used to create RESTful APIs that enable CompuJAI applications to communicate with each other and with external services. CompuJAI's framework includes utilities for defining API endpoints, handling request parameters, and generating response data in JSON format. The framework also provides built-in support for API authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users and applications can access sensitive data and functionalities. Documentation is automatically generated using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI, making it easy for developers to understand and use the APIs. Furthermore, CompuJAI's API design principles emphasize scalability, security, and ease of use. API endpoints are designed to be stateless and idempotent, allowing for easy scaling and fault tolerance. Security is paramount, with measures in place to prevent common API vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). By providing a robust and well-documented API framework, CompuJAI enables developers to build interconnected applications and integrate with a wide range of external services.

Deployment and Security Considerations
Deploying CompuJAI applications requires careful consideration of infrastructure, configuration, and security. Python virtual environments are used to isolate dependencies and ensure consistent behavior across different environments. The applications are typically deployed using containerization technologies like Docker, enabling easy deployment to various cloud platforms or on-premise servers. CompuJAI's framework includes tools for managing configuration settings, secrets, and environment variables. Security is a top priority, with measures in place to protect against common web application vulnerabilities. These measures include input validation, output encoding, authentication and authorization, and regular security audits. HTTPS is used to encrypt communication between the client and the server, and appropriate firewall rules are configured to restrict access to the application. Furthermore, CompuJAI provides mechanisms for monitoring application performance and logging errors, enabling developers to quickly identify and resolve issues. Regular backups are performed to ensure data integrity and recover from potential disasters. By adhering to these best practices, developers can ensure that their CompuJAI applications are deployed securely and reliably.",Other

"From the shadowed alleyways of a forgotten metropolis, arose the unlikely tale of young Ant, a child of the dust and the dreams. His genesis was a silent affair, fatherless and framed by the grim realities of a world too young to understand. But fate, as it often does, penned a sudden twist into his narrative. A philosopher of advanced years, weary of a world that he seemed both to admire and detest in equal measure, discovered Ant amongst the ruins of a place that seemed abandoned by progress.

He adopted the child, and his mother, embracing them both into a fold that promised refuge and new prospects. Under this paternal mentorship, Ant blossomed like a resilient wildflower amidst a barren landscape. His mind, nimble and thirsty, absorbed wisdom like the parched earth drinking rain. He was taught the art of debate, and his master delighted in engaging with him in thoughtful contemplation. He acquired knowledge of science and nature that even the local academy could not attain. His imagination was the most exciting, for it carried him to strange realms that none before him could speak of.

Alas, as the heavens allow little rest for saints and even less for men of interest, death crept into Ant's sanctuary as cancer was to rob us all of this shining new life. His passing was like a dimming of light. A book unfinished and tragically curtailed. The tragedy lies not only in the extinguishing of potential, but in the theft of a mind on the precipice of untold greatness. Though young Ant is dead, stories of him live on. He who lived as a philosopher has inspired so many men of importance, his voice will echo forever throughout the land.

But what do I care for him now, let it not bring me despair.",Other

INTRODUCTION
Several studies in recent decades have identified the absence of an integrated comprehensive dataset covering all of the UK’s museums [1, 18, 20, 32]. There is no comprehensive information of the museums currently in existence, museums that have closed, or the subject matter of these museums, and visitor numbers are only recorded for accredited museums, which make up only around 50% of the total. There are particular gaps in the data with respect to small independent museums run by community or special interest groups, and there are no longitudinal records whatsoever [3]. Without this information, it is impossible to understand the emergence, evolution and wider impact of the UK museums sector, or to grasp the history of the sector as a whole. The lack of coherent data also has implications for policy makers especially in relation to growth, sustainability, subject coverage, and regional and national disparities in museum distribution.

This lack of integrated, comprehensive information about the UK’s museum sector motivates the research of the “Mapping Museums” project1. Mapping Museums aims to develop a comprehensive database of UK museums in existence since 1960 and use it to undertake an evidence-based analysis of the development of the UK’s museum sector since 1960 and the links to wider cultural, social, and political concerns2. Mapping Museums (MM) is an interdisciplinary project involving researchers from art history, museology, computer science, and geographic information science (GIScience). During the first two years of the project, the research team has gathered, cleansed and codified data relating to over 4000 UK museums — almost double the number of museums covered in any previous survey, and covering the whole period from 1960 to date. This process has been lengthy and challenging, involving the need to identify and integrate existing data sources, rectify gaps and inconsistencies in the data; and also to develop a common conceptualisation of what constitutes a museum and what are the key attributes of museums that need to be captured in order to support the project’s historical research objectives.
A key part of the project has involved eliciting the evolving knowledge and requirements of the project’s humanities scholars by means of iterative, participatory design of a new RDF/S Knowledge Base to store the data and metadata relating to the museums, and a Web Application allowing them to browse, search and visualise the data in order to investigate their research questions3. This paper describes the challenges we faced in developing the Knowledge Base (KB) and Web Application (Web App), the methodology and methods we adopted, the design and implementation of the KB and Web App, and the design and outcomes of a user evaluation study undertaken with a diverse group of independent museum experts.
A key methodological challenge was that development of the KB and the Web App needed to start well before the end of the data collection phase: this is because the data collection has taken over two years and the development of the KB and Web App also needed to be completed within that same time frame according to the project’s timing and funding schedule. It was also not possible to wait until the KB and Web App were finalised before beginning the historical research work that the KB and Web App would support. Moreover, the incremental accrual of data and knowledge served to incrementally elucidate the historical research questions to be investigated: it was not possible to formulate these questions in detail ahead of starting the KB and Web App development, and indeed the initial research proposal had formulated its research questions in high level terms, exactly because of the lack of comprehensive data and knowledge of the sector.
These parallel and incremental activities of (i) data and knowledge accrual, (ii) KB and Web App development, and (iii) research question elucidation, have necessitated the adoption of a rapid prototyping approach to the development of the KB and Web App. The staffing resource funded for their development was 21 months of one (experienced) full-time software developer, further necessitating the application of agile software development principles. The incremental accrual of data and metadata also informed the approach taken towards designing the Web App, in that our software is metadata-driven, making the system easily extensible with additional attributes of museums, as well data about new museums.
A key contribution of this paper is therefore the methodology and methods we adopted to successfully design and implement the KB and the Web App within these tight scheduling, resourcing and data collection constraints (the timeline of the MM project is summarised in Appendix A). A further contribution is the design and outcomes of a user evaluation study of the KB and Web App undertaken with a diverse group of independent domain experts, and the insights gained. Beyond our own project, the methodology, methods and designs we present here have the potential to inform other projects that aim to create knowledge-rich resources through interdisciplinary research across computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences.

Related Work. There has been much work over the past decade in gathering and publishing museum and cultural heritage data as Linked Open data [2, 5, 11, 12, 14, 17], typically using the CIDOC CRM [4] as the de facto standard schema. These efforts capture detailed information about cultural artefacts, and require mapping from museums’ internal datasets to this standard or to some other fixed schema. Our work contrasts with this as our primary motivation is to support the research of humanities scholars in investigating the development of a whole museum sector. Because of the heterogeneity of the input datasets, and the continual evolution of the domain experts’ conceptualisations and identification of museums’ attributes that needed to be captured in order to support their research, it was not possible to adopt or specify from the outset a fixed schema. In any case, the CIDOC CRM was not appropriate for our purposes as it provides rich formalisms for describing the cultural heritage domain and cultural heritage artefacts, rather than museums’ governance, accreditation, thematic focus, opening/closing, and geodemographic context, which were of highest importance for the MM project. Another point of differentiation of our work is that we needed to develop our KB and Web App concurrently, whereas previous projects that have published cultural heritage datasets have tended to first create the dataset and subsequently to turn to developing applications for users to explore the data.
We note here the IMLS dataset of USA museums, which is similar in scope to our own dataset and covers some 30,000 museums4. Its stated aim is to be “useful to researchers, journalists, the public, local practitioners, and policymakers at the federal, state, and local levels for planning, evaluation, and policy making.” This is a much more general aim than the specific historical research investigation of the UK museum sector being undertaken by the MM project. Thus, IMLS has a coarse discipline-based classification of the thematic focus of museums, as compared to the detailed Subject Matter taxonomy that we developed in our project (see Section 3.3). It does not include the equivalent of our governance and accreditation status attributes, nor does it include opening/closing dates of museums. On the other hand, it does include finance information, which was not within the scope of our own research. It also uses a narrower definition of what constitutes a “museum” than the one required for the MM’s project historical research5.
The MM Knowledge Base comprises both an ontology part (expressed in RDFS) and an instance data part (expressed in RDF). In this context, an “ontology” allows the representation of explicit and implied concepts relevant to a particular domain [9, 10]. Many ontology development methodologies have been proposed over the past 20 years, including METHONTOLOGY [7], On-To-Knowledge Methodology [31], DILIGENT [24], UPON [6], HCOME [15], NEON [30]. Earlier methodologies tended to follow a phased development approach, for example in the case of METHONTOLOGY comprising successive phases of requirements specification, conceptualisation, formalisation, integration, implementation, and maintenance. For the reasons stated earlier, it was not feasible for us to follow a phased approach to developing the MM project’s KB, and indeed we have iteratively pursued requirements specification, conceptualisation, formalisation, integration, implementation and validation steps throughout the first two years of the project. In this respect, our approach has commonalities with DILIGENT and HCOME which emphasise the evolving nature of an ontology specification. However, our KB has been developed concurrently with the incremental data collection and the Web App, and has informed and been informed by these parallel activities. In contrast, ontology development methodologies generally aim to capture domain knowledge independently of the requirements of any particular application.
Early ontology development methodologies tended to be designed for the knowledge engineer rather than the domain expert. Only more recently (e.g. in HCOME and NEON) is an active role for domain experts within the ontology development lifecycle envisaged. Similarly to HCOME, the MM project’s domain experts are central to the KB development lifecycle and tools are provided for them to be able to fulfil their role: specifically, the Browse

facility of the Web App itself, into which successive versions of our ontology were immediately embedded by the project’s software developer. Similarly to NEON, ontology development is undertaken collaboratively by users, domain experts and software developers. In our case the primary users and primary domain experts were one and the same, namely the MM project’s humanities scholars, and they participated in the ontology requirements specification, conceptualisation and validation, while the project’s computer scientists and GIScience experts focussed on formalisation, integration and implementation. Additional domain experts and user stakeholders from the UK museum sector were also involved in parts of the specification and conceptualisation process (see Section 3.3). An additional challenge in the MM project was that the domain experts’ knowledge and detailed research questions evolved concurrently with their data collection and their participation in the ontology development process, informing and being informed by this process.
Outline of the paper. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section identifies the major challenges faced by the MM project in developing a KB and Web App to meet the needs of its humanities scholars. Section 3 presents our methodology and methods, focussing on the overall development process, data collection, conceptual modelling, KB development, and Web App development. Section 4 gives an overview of the Web App from the viewpoint of a user, and also technical details of how it and the KB have been implemented. Section 5 describes the design and conduct of a user trial of our system with a broad group of stakeholders from the UK’s museums sector, and analyzes the outcomes of the trial. Section 6 summarises the innovations and contributions of the research described here and identifies areas of further work.
RESEARCH CHALLENGES
The Mapping Museums project exhibits the typical challenges of interdisciplinary research projects that aim to build a software prototype as part of their remit6. Firstly, there is a need to develop a common “language of discourse” between researchers from different disciplines. Often, a term has a different meanings in different disciplines e.g. “ontology”, “design”, “implementation”, and developing a common understanding of the contextual usage of such terms across the different disciplines is required. Secondly, there is typically a lack of well-defined software requirements at the outset of the project, and so identifying outline requirements on the basis of which to begin to design an initial prototype is a necessary first step. The research typically then progresses in an iterative fashion, comprising successive cycles of requirements elicitation, research and design, implementation, testing and trialling, in a close collaboration between computer scientists, domain experts and users/user stakeholders. Thirdly, there is a need to develop an understanding of, and sensitivity to, the research challenges and the ways of working of the other disciplines. For example, in the MM project, a key difference in the ways of working related to the entity names and attribute values to be used within the KB and Web App. Having cross-team discussions early on helped the non-computer scientists appreciate the need for precision when specifying names and values within the input data being compiled, and to therefore make more effective use of their time as they were collecting, defining and cleansing the data.
The MM project exhibits additional challenges arising from its specific aim to develop a new KB and Web App
to support the research of the project’s humanities scholars:
there is no single existing dataset upon which to base the design of the KB, due to the currently incomplete knowledge of the UK’s museum sector;
the development of conceptualisations and knowledge models by the project’s domain experts is part of the research project itself;
there is incremental collection and integration of data from diverse sources; additional data sources become known, or available, during the course of the project;

6Specifically, the MM project exhibits the characteristics of Broad, Cooperative, Integrated, Methodological, Bridge-Building, Instrumental and Exogenous, from the taxonomy of interdisciplinary research presented in [13].


the data exhibits incompleteness, uncertainty and contradictions that need to be resolved or handled; there is incremental development of the humanities scholars’ conceptual model in tandem with this incremental collection of the data;
there is sometimes uncertainty, controversy and multiple viewpoints from the range of domain experts and stakeholders, which need to be discussed, debated and resolved;
it is difficult to specify the system requirements for searching, visualising and analysing the data while the conceptual model development and data collection are still in progress;
these requirements continue to evolve as long as the conceptual model and data continue to evolve.
METHODOLOGY
The parallel activities of data collection and collation, development of conceptualisations, elucidation of historical research questions, and development of the KB and Web App that would support the project’s historical research, posed unique challenges and pointed to the need to adopt a participatory software development methodology: participatory design actively involves all stakeholders in an iterative design process [29] so as to ensure that the viewpoints and needs of all stakeholders inform the design at all stages. It also pointed to the need to adopt semantic technologies (specifically in our case, RDF/S) to develop the KB: representing both data and schema information in the form of (subject,predicate,object) triples allows the evolving relationships between entities to be captured in fine detail; the schema and the data can easily be extended with new triples as new knowledge or data accrue; and it is possible to extend the evolving schema with other existing taxonomies (specifically in our case, with the geographical Administrative Area hierarchy of the Office for National Statistics7 - see Section 3.4). Moreover, as mentioned earlier, data quality is variable due to incompleteness, inconsistency and uncertainty across the input datasets. Data quality does improve as the data is completed and cleansed, but as new data and knowledge accrue so new data quality issues arise. The evolving data and schema cause an inevitable burden on the software development effort, pointing to the need to adopt Rapid Application Development techniques so as to mitigate against the time loss. We describe in detail in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 the key software design methods
that we employed, which include:
making the Web App metadata-driven; as well as automatically accommodating updates to the data (e.g. correction of data about a museum, insertion of missing data items, addition of data about a new museum), the software easily accommodates changes to the schema within its Browse, Search and Visualise facilities; developing a small number of data abstractions; this enables rapid extension of the KB and Web App following extensions to the schema, since each schema extension is an instantiation of an existing, or a new, data abstraction;
using software introspection; this allows the Web App to automatically build its Browse, Search and Visualise user interfaces using the data abstractions; moreover, the names of all concepts are derived from the KB and appear as-such in the GUI (as do all data values).
Appendix A gives a summary of the successive iterations of the KB and the Web App over the first 24 months of the MM project. In particular, Version 8 of the KB is coupled with Version 0.1 of the Web App, which is the version that underwent the formative evaluation that is described in Section 5 of this paper. The iterations of the KB and Web App listed in Appendix A were formal internal releases, but between them numerous additional iterations took place to locate and correct spelling, formatting or type errors in the data, improve the data upload facilities, design and experiment with new data abstractions, and validate the incrementally added new data. Another advantage of developing early versions of the Browse and Search facilities was that data validation could be carried out using early versions of the Web App software itself. Intermediate iterations were carried out on a development server, while baseline iterations were released on a production server to support the

ongoing research of the humanities scholars. We give in Section 3.1 an overview of the overall iterative process for developing the KB and the Web App. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 describe the data collection and conceptual modelling processes, Section 3.4 the development of the KB and Section 3.5 the development of the Web App.
Overview of our development process
Figure 1 gives an overview of the iterative development process for the KB and the Web App. Data was collected within three input spreadsheets (this being a tool that the project’s domain experts were familiar with and confident in using) : a core spreadsheet containing one row per museum and some 50 columns; a governance changes spreadsheet that stores historical information about changes in governance for some 30 museums; and a visitor numbers spreadsheet that stores historical information about recorded visitor numbers for some 2300 museums.
The core spreadsheet includes in its header the name and the data type of each column (data types may be from the xsd name space8 or one of our data abstractions — see Section 3.4). It contains one row per museum, with each cell representing a property of the museum. The other two spreadsheets have similar headers, but contain a separate row for each governance change and each visitor numbers measurement, respectively. Each spreadsheet is programmatically analysed for formatting or data type errors, and these are corrected in collaboration with the project’s domain experts.
A step of pre-processing is applied to extend the core spreadsheet with additional data for the Museum Size, geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude), and Administrative Area values of each museum. A graphML representation is then automatically generated from the core s/sheet header and uploaded to the yED tool9. Additional manual schema extensions were made to this using the yED editor so as to encompass the temporal data model governing the historical visitor numbers data and governance change data.
An RDFS representation is exported from yED in the form of a set of graphML files, one for each of the three input spreadsheets, and an RDFS template is created from each graphML file using a Python program. The RDFS templates are combined with the s/sheet data (in CSV format) to generate the RDF/S triples in N3 again using a Python program. Finally, this is converted to RDF/XML (using RDF2RDF10) and loaded into the KB (Virtuoso11).
Data collection
There have been numerous government surveys of UK museums in the past 60 years, including by:
The Museums and Galleries Commission [19, 34]. During 1994-1999, its Digest of Museum Statistics (DOMUS) survey collected information on some 1700 accredited museums. When that project ended most of the data was deposited in the National Archives12.
The Standing Committee on Museums and Galleries [27, 33].
The Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in England (which replaced the Museums and Galleries Commission) [8, 18].
The Northern Ireland Museums Council [23].
The Scottish Museums Council (now Museums and Galleries Scotland) [16, 28].
The Welsh Museums, Archives and Libraries Division [21].

in 1983 the Association of Independent Museums (AIM) surveyed independent museums;
in 1987 the Museums Association established the Museums.UK database project, which produced the first digitally available survey [25];
from 1955 Museums Association produced a Yearbook (previously Museums Calendar) that recorded details of all its members, and currently supports a paid subscription service offering this information (the Find-A-Museum service13).
None of these surveys aimed to provide a single, comprehensive dataset covering the whole of the UK museum sector: they each had different purposes and encompassed different subsets of museums. There was also a lack of a single data collection standard across the different surveys, for example relating to whether, and how, museums’ locations, subject matter, opening/closing dates and visitor numbers are recorded. Moreover, much of the data that was collected has been lost over the years, most notably all of the data from the Museums.UK project of 1987; or it has been poorly archived, for example the DOMUS data which was missing full explanation of all the data encodings employed; or is only available for a fee or on request14. Other inconsistencies in the data arise from different and changing conceptions of what constitutes a “museum”. This has resulted in uneven data collection practices: for example, venues that are missing from earlier reviews do appear in later ones, and there are differences in the definition of what constitutes a museum across the four countries of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)15.
Data Collation. The Digest of Museum Statistics (DOMUS), 1994-1999, was the most comprehensive existing dataset (covering some 2,000 museums) and the starting point of our own data collection. It comprises several hundred spreadsheets that had to be understood and reassembled so that data distributed across numerous DOMUS spreadsheets resulted in a single row for each museum in our own core spreadsheet. We also ensured that some attribute names and data values were more meaningful than had been the case before. Having manually cleansed, improved and reassembled the DOMUS data, we proceeded to extend it with data from the other contemporary and historical datasets listed above. This too was done using copy-and-paste methods as there was

no reliable way, within the time and resource constraints of the project, of automating the integration of these very disparate datasets.
Each museum recorded in our core spreadsheet was assigned a unique identifier including as one of its components the primary source of data about this museum, e.g. the identifier mm.domus.WM014 relates to museum WM014 originally sourced from DOMUS. Typically, a museum’s entry in the spreadsheet would gradually be extended with the discovery of new data about it from other sources. With such additions, additional columns would be added to the core spreadsheet, and the source of each new data item would also be included in an adjacent ‘provenance’ column.
Criteria for inclusion of venues. Official definitions of what constitutes a museum (such as that of the International Council of Museums — ICOM — and the UK Museums Association) are oriented towards professional practice, setting standards that cannot be matched by many small amateur and community museums; they therefore exclude large numbers of venues and produce a skewed representation of the sector 16. In the MM project, our criteria for including venues within the KB needed to be broader than existing official definitions to ensure that independent and grassroots museums were fully captured. We consulted online resources such as museums’ websites and Wikipedia to source a wider spread of entities that are considered as being “museums” by the public. We sometimes used visitors’ comments on TripAdvisor to ascertain whether a venue could be deemed a museum. Phrases such as ‘this nice museum...’ were clear indications, but also terms like ‘exhibitions’, ‘displays’, ‘historic’, ‘cultural experience’ helped us understand how the venue was being framed and experienced by visitors. To establish our criteria for inclusion we took the lead from prototype theory from the cognitive sciences, which recognises that objects within a category do not necessarily all share the same attributes and that some attributes may be more central to the category than others [26]. For example, the British Museum occupies a large neo-classical building and has eight million objects in its collection, while the Burston Strike School Museum is located in a tiny building and only has a handful of items on display, but both are recognisably museums. Generally, we expected museums to have a collection of objects on display, be open to the public (even if only for limited periods of time), occupy a demarcated display space, and be engaged in the preservation of the display objects.
Data cleansing. The data collection process often required cross-checking data about the same museum
arising from different sources and resolving any inconsistencies. In such cases, data from the source deemed most authoritative was selected, and the conflicting data values were recorded in an additional Notes column relating to the attribute in question. Data from government surveys was treated as being most reliable, and we were more circumspect with data from other sources.
The data collection process also required tracking down information that was not present in any data source, which related mainly to museums’ locations, governance status, opening and closing dates, and visitor numbers. To do this we consulted historic guidebooks, gazetteers and regional guides, specialist museums sources, and digital resources (search engines, the BBC 1986 Domesday project). Individual museums’ entries were validated and completed in consultation with museums staff, tourist boards and local history societies, by phone, email and twitter. We also held a series of face-to-face data validation exercises with all nine regional branches of the UK Museum Development Network, during which the data was examined line-by-line. Additional validation was undertaken with museum consultants (notably, Adrian Babbidge) and staff from English Heritage, Historic Environment Scotland, Historic Houses, ACE, Museums Galleries Scotland, and Museums Archives Libraries Division17.

the data” and “Picking the brains of the Museum Development Network”, and the Events post “AIM: I’m going to map forever”, at http://blogs.bbk.ac.uk/mapping-museums/


This first stage of data collection was accompanied in parallel by the design of a first version of the conceptual model of our database, focussing on those attributes of museums that would be needed for the project’s historical research. This conceptual model was encoded within the header of the core spreadsheet, including both attribute names and data types. The main attributes identified as being of importance were museums’ accreditation status, location (postal address and administrative location), governance status, size, subject matter, year of opening, and year of closing (if any). Additional attributes, chiefly relating to the provenance of the different items of data that we were collecting, were added over the whole two-year time span of the data collection process.
Handling missing data. The outcome of the first phase of data collection (at 20 Months) was a core s/sheet comprising over 50 items of data relating to around 4000 museums, as well as two additional s/sheets holding data about museums’ changes in governance status and changes in visitor numbers over time. By this stage we had complete coverage of most attributes apart from visitor numbers, governance, opening date and closing date: specifically, we had governance information for 92% of museums, year of opening for 88% of museums, year of closing for 68% of museums that were known to have closed, and visitor numbers for 67% of museums.
For the missing governance data, we created a sub-category of Unknown governance. For missing open- ing/closing dates, we recorded an interval of the form [earliest possible year of opening, latest possible year of opening]. We tried to make these intervals as narrow as possible by searching for references to the museum being open or closed in a given year within the historical and digital resources mentioned above, and through the data validation exercises held with the stakeholder groups mentioned earlier. TripAdvisor also served as a crowdsourcing tool in this respect, allowing us to find out which years visitors had visited the site, with the absence of a designated page for a museum being an indication that it had closed.
For visitor numbers, disparities in the way that this data is recorded in different primary data sources in any case made it difficult to compare like with like. Our primary requirement was to use visitor numbers as an indication of the size of a museum. We therefore decided to gross visitor numbers into museum size categories of Huge (1M+ visitors per year), Large (50,000-1M), Medium (10,000-50,000) and Small (0-10,000), as well as a sub-category Unknown. As noted earlier, about 33% of museums had no visitor numbers data, and this proportion of museums of Unknown size was deemed to be inadequate for the project’s analytical purposes. We therefore adopted a machine learning approach to estimate these museums’ size from their other attributes, noting that the distribution of museum size is not random but statistically correlated to other attributes (e.g. independent, unaccredited museums tend to be small). The best-performing model, based on a random forest classifier implemented in R18, estimated museum size from accreditation, governance, subject matter, region, country, and geodemographic classification of the area. This model reaches 86% classification accuracy (with p <
.001), leaving only 1.6% of museums with Unknown size, which we considered sufficient for the project’s research aims. The signal was particularly strong for small and large museums and slightly weaker for medium museums, which were double-checked manually by the project team. The Size Provenance attribute associated with each museum enables the user to ascertain whether the size information comes from recorded visitor information, is derived from other attributes, or manually set19.
Conceptual Modelling
Co-developing graphical conceptual models from the outset of the project allowed us to gradually develop a common understanding across the whole team of the schema of the KB. These models were initially hand-drawn diagrams on paper, whiteboards or powerpoint, and were subsequently modelled using the yED tool. The format of

19Further details of the variability of the visitor numbers data and the derivation of the Museum Size attribute can be found in the Research posts on “Missing, massaged, and just wrong: Problems with visitor numbers” and “How big is that museum” at http://blogs.bbk.ac.uk/mapping- museums/


the core spreadsheet was kept “in synch” with this evolving conceptual model. Most of the graphical specification was automatically extracted from the metadata header of the core spreadsheet as described in Section 3.2.
Also necessary was the design of a new Subject Matter taxonomy for the museums identified by the project team. The most recent taxonomy for classifying the overall theme of a museum (as opposed to artefacts or collections within a museum) was devised as part of DOMUS in 1994 and structured according to traditional academic disciplines. Although this system is still in use by the Museums Association, it does not encompass non-academic subject areas targeted by some newer, independent museums, nor does it provide sufficient detail for the project’s research purposes. A new taxonomy therefore had to be designed. Successive versions of the taxonomy were reviewed with domain experts and stakeholders external to the project20. This iterative design process continued from month 6 to month 18 of the project, resulting in a new museum Subject Matter taxonomy that is itself a major research contribution of the MM project.
Developing the Knowledge Base
After fifteen months, the project team had gathered data on about 4000 museums. However, as described earlier, the process was incremental and we continued to add to the data as new museums were identified or missing items of information were found. We also refined our criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and some museums were deleted or added as the criteria for what constitutes a museum evolved. The conceptual model has also changed repeatedly, for example with the addition of historical data for visitor numbers and governance changes, and also the need to integrate our data with the Administrative Area hierarchy embedded within the ONS Postcode Lookup Dataset21 so as to support geographical analysis of the museums data. To achieve this integration, and also to support map-based visualisation of the data, we first needed to extend the conceptual model to capture the geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude) of each museum and to generate lat/long data for each museum. For museums that had accurately recorded Postal Codes, this was achieved by accessing the Postcode Lookup Dataset. Over 150 of the closed museums had deprecated postal codes and a manual investigation and data entry was needed for these in order to record a valid postcode.
Thus, the evolving KB has had to be flexible enough to encompass new or changed data, and to continue to do so as the sector changes or as new information is incorporated. We therefore opted to use semantic technologies to describe and store our data, specifically RDF and RDFS22. This data model allows us to describe in fine detail the different relationships between entities and also allows easy extension with new subject-object-predicate triples as new data and knowledge accrue. We used the class, subclass, object property, data property, domain and range axioms of RDFS (it was not necessary to use a more expressive ontology language such as OWL). As new data was discovered and scheduled for inclusion into the KB, the number of columns, column names and data types of the core spreadsheet changed frequently, necessitating the creation of a new version of the KB every few weeks.
Due to the evolving nature of the conceptual model, and our observation that certain types of sub-models were recurring, we created an extensible set of data abstractions to help both the humanities scholars refine their evolving conceptualisation of the domain and the software developer to rapidly extend the current versions of the KB and Web App with the new conceptualisations and new data. A number of abstractions were incrementally identified: Lists, Hierarchies, Intervals and Events:
Lists are collections of values describing some property of a museum, e.g. the Size of a museum may be Huge, Large, Medium, Small or Unknown. The list of values is populated directly from the data entries in the relevant spreadsheet column (and is thus automatically updated if the range of values needs to be changed).

22https://www.w3.org/RDF/, https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/


Hierarchies are tree-structured classifications that allow the expression of a taxonomy of values within the data. Examples are the Governance and Subject Matter properties of a museum. The taxonomy is again built directly from the data entries appearing in the relevant spreadsheet column. For example the value Independent: English Heritage represents a path from the class Governance, to the subclass Independent and the sub-subclass English Heritage; and the value Leisure and sport:Fairgrounds and amusements represents a path from the class Subject Matter to the subclass Leisure and sport and the sub-subclass Fairgrounds and amusements.
Intervals describe a date (a year in our case) where the exact year is unknown for a museum’s opening or closing date. These too are populated from the entries appearing in the relevant spreadsheet column (expressed in the form of a pair of years x:y, e.g. 1977:1988).
Event data relates to historical information about museums’ changing visitor numbers and governance status. This was collected from numerous sources including DOMUS, the Museums Association Find-A-Museum service, Arts Council England accreditation data, Association of Independent Museums, Visit Britain, and the National Audit Office. To model this information, a TemporalMeasurement class abstraction was created to hold sequences of from and to values, which uses the TemporalEntity class of the OWL Time Ontology23 to record a time interval and the Entity class of the PROV ontology24 to record the provenance of each measurement.
We show below some metrics for the KB, separated into modules corresponding to the three input spreadsheets.

Developing the Web Application
The Web App was developed in an evolutionary manner in parallel with the data collection, conceptual modelling, and creation of the KB. The humanities scholars’ initial research questions guided initial data modelling. We then embarked on co-design of a first version of data browsing and searching capabilities. It was evident that geospatial analysis of the museums data would be required, together the ability to show the locations of museums on a visual map. Further refinement of the research questions allowed specification, design and development of visualisation facilities to analyse and summarise the museums data in a variety of dimensions. This process resulted in a Web App that has three main facilities:
Browse: Drill down into the museums data through properties such as Accreditation, Governance, Size, Subject Matter, Location, Year opened and Year closed. View the resulting museums on a map of the UK, or in tabular form showing key properties, or on a museum-by-museum basis with full details for each museum.
Search: Search the museums data by specifying one or more filter conditions and the properties to be returned in the result set. View the resulting museums on a map, or in tabular form showing the selected properties, or on a museum-by-museum basis with full details for each museum.
Visualise: View bar charts and line graphs to explore research questions on aspects of opening and closing of museums over time, allowing drilling down into dimensions such as Accreditation, Governance, Size, Subject Matter and Location. Provide also heat maps allowing cross-tabulation of these dimensions over time.


23https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/ 24https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/


For all three facilities, the GUI and user interaction were designed and refined by the whole project team produc- ing hand-drawn sketches on paper and whiteboards. For the Visualise facility, the computer scientists began by pre- senting the humanities scholars with palettes of possible charts and diagrams (e.g. github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery, bl.ocks.org/) and the whole project team worked together to discuss and refine possible visualisations for the information that would be required to investigate the project’s evolving research questions. The development timeline of the Web App is summarised in Appendix A.
The frequent changes in the conceptual model, and hence in the schema of the KB, led to the decision to make the Web App metadata-driven so as to be able to keep up with these rapid changes. The RDFS template generation of Figure 1 extracts the values comprising each List and Hierarchy data abstraction, as well as the properties of museums required to be presented within the Browse, Search and Visualise GUIs, and these are stored within the KB. New data and schema changes automatically become available in the GUI (e.g correction of data about a museum, insertion of missing data items, addition of new data about a new museum, changes to the schema). The more complex temporal data and imported Admininistrative Area data require some further information in order to be fully supported within the Web App. This is achieved through a Python interface class containing methods for:
displaying the appropriate name for the attribute in the GUI
declaring the list of comparison operators for Search on the attribute
implementing the HTML required for the user to enter values of that data type and the associated Javascript
generating SPARQL for a filter on that attribute
generating SPARQL for a query on the attribute, calling the above method for filter construction
displaying values of this attribute returned from users’ queries.
Implementation classes are written to instantiate these methods for each type of data. This approach allows for easy extensibility of the application with new derived or imported data. For example, towards the end of Year 2, the project’s humanities scholars requested an additional property for each museum, “In Existence”, which is logically derived from the Year Open/Year Closed data and needed to be interrogated within Search in the same way as all other properties (see Online Appendix C). This was readily handled through building a new implementation class for the above interface.
Towards the end of the KB and Web App development process, the project’s humanities and GIScience scholars requested that the museums data be extended with additional information about the Deprivation Index25 and Area Classification26 relating to the location of each museum. The integration of this data was accomplished in less than a day of development time, by extending the pre-processing step on the core spreadsheet to encompass this data also, resulting in its expansion with three additional columns (Deprivation index, Geodemographic group, Geodemographic subgroup). We note that this data was not part of Version 0.1 which is the version of the system that we focus on here and that underwent the formative user evaluation described in Section 5.
SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Figure 2 shows the architecture of our system. We see that it has a typical three-tier architecture comprising a Web Browser-based client served by a Web Server connecting to a Database Server. The Knowledge Base is implemented as a triple store, using Virtuoso, and supports a SPARQL end point for communicating with the Web Server. The web server, Apache/WSGI, uses the Python Flask27 framework with Jinja template views28 to

deliver HTML/Javascript pages to the client. The pages are styled with Bootstrap29 and CSS. Communication with the database server is through the Python SPARQLWrapper library.
Design of the user interface was informed by Nielsen’s ten usability heuristics [22]. Users interact with the Web Application through the screen illustrated in Figure 3, which provides a separate tab for the Browse, Search and Visualise facilities. The default entry screen shows a map of the UK displaying clusters of museums and the number of museums per cluster. The map can be zoomed into, so as to show finer-grained clusters and ultimately individual museums visualised as pins. It is also possible to toggle the view to directly display only individual museums. Clicking on a cluster also results in a zoom-in and display of the individual museums of the cluster. Hovering over a pin displays the name of the museum. Clicking on a pin shows a screen with full details of the data held about the museum (see Figure 6).
Browse. The Browse facility allows users to navigate through the museums data in a structured way, through the categories of accreditation, governance, location, size, subject matter classification, year of opening and year of closing. For example, Figure 4 has drilled down through Year Opened into the 1980s decade and then into the specific year 1980, to select museums that opened in 1980. The results can be viewed in a map view, as in Figure 4, or in a list view, as in Figure 5. Users can select a specific museum to see full details of the data held about it, or page through all museums one at a time to see their details, as in Figure 6.
In Browse, KB introspection (as discussed in Section 3.4) is used to generate the left-hand side menu. The number of museum references accessible through this menu exceeds 40,000 and a CSS-based view provided the most efficient solution for navigating through the menu structure, also allowing for further growth (e.g. with the recent addition of Deprivation Index and Geodemographic data). Currently, just over 7MB of data is transferred to Browse upon loading the Browse page. To keep the GUI responsive, a few attribute values are loaded for all museums (name, lat/long, subject matter) and only when switching to the Details view does the browser request the full data for the selected museum from the server.
Search. The Search facility allows users to set up their own queries, over a broad range of attributes of museums. Users specify one or more filters that can be combined to create more complex search criteria. Each filter is of the form Attribute Operator Value and a range of operators are supported for each data type (xsd data type or abstract data type). The museums’ attributes to be returned in the results can also be specified by the user. Figure 7 shows a completed query, with two filters (Admin Area Matches Aberdeen and Accreditation Matches Accredited). The results of a query can again be viewed in a list as in that figure, on a map as in Figure 8, or in detail for each museum (Figure 6).

Fig. 3. Web Application entry screen.

In Search, text entry and selection from drop-down menus are supported for the various attributes, and KB introspection allows the correct widgets and operators to be displayed in the GUI. The filters constructed by the user are combined into a conjunction of clauses within a SPARQL query while the output attributes selected are mapped to variables in the query’s SELECT clause. The most complex SPARQL queries generated by Search relate to the handling of dates and their extensive range of operators, listed in online Appendix B. The awesomplete30 JavaScript library is used to provide autocompletion of Admin Area names. Due to the size of the Admin Area hierarchy, the web server runs a Flask API service that incrementally loads as needed sub-trees of that hierarchy. The Map view supported in Browse and Search has been developed using the Leaflet31 Javascript library together with the MarkerCluster32 plug-in to create the clusters. The maps themselves are dynamically loaded using the Openstreetmap service33.

Visualise. The Visualise facility supports a range of bar charts and line graphs relating to museum openings and closings, allowing the user to drill down into dimensions such as governance, subject matter, size and location. For example, Figure 9 shows the number of museums that were open in 2017 broken down by subject matter classification. The temporal slider at the bottom of the graph allows the user to dynamically change the selected year. Figure 10 shows the number of museums opening in each year from 1960 to 2018, and Figure 11 shows the same information broken down by governance. Similar graphs are supported for museum closures. Figure 12 shows a comparison of openings and closings on one graph. In all cases, zoom-in facilities are supported to aid the user when a chart or graph becomes too dense.
Also supported are heatmaps for cross-tabulating selected pairs of categories, e.g. Subject Matter versus Location to see in which parts of the country different types of museums occur most frequently. Figure 13 illustrates a heatmap where Subject Matter (X axis) is tabulated against Governance (Y axis). Each cell shows the number of museums open in the year selected via the temporal slider (2017 in this case) that fall into each cell of the table. So, for example, we see that in 2017 there are 408 museums open that are Independent and whose subject matter is Local Histories. As with the bar charts and line graphs, it is possible to drill down into sub-categories of the categories selected for the X or Y axis.




Fig. 5. Browsing into the Year Opened category, List View.

For the Visualise facility, the Bokeh34 library is used to produce the line graphs, bar charts and heatmaps for delivery from the server to the client. Again, as with Browse and Search, KB introspection allows extensible handling of both xsd and abstract data types. For the heatmaps, the large number of possible cross-tabulation combinations was handled by routing the selected X,Y combination to the web server, which in turn constructs a method call invoking the correct object for constructing the page content (again, this is a dynamically extensible capability, allowing new categories to be added to the X,Y options for the user).
Opening/Closing dates. A final point of note is that museum opening and closing dates that comprise an interval of the form [earliest possible year, latest possible year] - as opposed to a single known year - are handled differently in the Browse, Search and Visualise facilities in order to meet the overview, search, and analysis requirements, respectively, of the humanities researchers. In Browse, museums’ opening and closing dates are regarded as occurring at the mid-point of the specified interval. Search provides a more nuanced approach, supporting both Definitely and Possibly modalities for all of the date comparison operators (the full list of operators supported is shown in Online Appendix B). For example, if a user searches for museums that definitely opened between 1975 and 1980 then she will see results for those museums whose Year Open date (be it a single year or an interval) falls within the interval [1975,1980]; whereas if she searches for museums that possibly

Fig. 6. Museum Details View.


opened between 1975 and 1980 then she will see results for those museums whose Year Open date (be it a single year or an interval) has a non-empty intersection with the interval [1975,1980]. In Visualise, the probability of an opening/closing event occurrence is apportioned equally over the years comprising the interval. For example, if a museum is known to have opened in the interval [1965,1969], then the count of one museum opening is divided over those five years (i.e. a count of 0.2 is assigned to each of 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969). The same approach is adopted for museums with longer date ranges and for date ranges relating to closure.
Summary. Overall, the Web Application comprises some 28000 lines of Python code, 25000 lines of Javascript, numerous HTML pages, and additional configuration files. It has been kept simple with a stateless approach free from sessions and cookies. Browse, Search and Visualise all have initialisation utilities to construct their menus on first invocation, using introspection into the KB as described earlier. This takes a few seconds (unless the data has changed since the last usage, in which case initialisation takes around 4 minutes). Due to the rapid prototyping process adopted for developing the KB and Web App, it was necessary to be able to quickly show new versions of them to project members, for validation, correction and extension. We used the Fabric35 Python-based deployment language to deploy multiple versions of code and data in parallel, allowing the project members to explore and assess their differences, and come to decisions about next steps of the development process.

Version 0.2 of the source code and documentation are available at github.com/nickatbbkdcs/MappingMuseums The final version of the Wep App code, and a download of the finalised KB in the form of Linked Open Data will be available from the project Web Site in late 2019.
The museums data will continue to be updated and extended up to the end of the project in December 2020. To enable this, we are developing a new web service to allow the capture of data updates relating to existing museums and also the insertion of data about new museums. There are separate forms for public upload of such data (thus supporting a form of crowd sourcing) and for validation/correction/rejection of data by the project’s domain experts before upload to the KB.

USER EVALUATION
We undertook an evaluation study based on user testing, designed to assess both usefulness and usability concerns. We designed a range of activities to test the Browse, Search and Visualise functionalities of the Web App. Users were invited to reflect upon these activities as they progressed as regards the ease-of-use of the system. At the end of the sequence of activities, they were invited to complete a survey structured around aesthetics, navigation, understandability and performance of the user interface, as well as usefulness of the system. The session concluded with a group discussion.

User Study Design
We recruited 15 volunteer participants via our network of professional contacts working in the UK museums sector, including a Museum Consultant, a Digital Archivist, several Museum Accreditation assessors, Museum Development Network officers, Cultural Heritage experts, and staff from AIM and ACE. None of these people had had any involvement in the design of the system.
We held three identically structured sessions each attended by a subset of the full set of participants. Other than very minor user interface changes, the same version of the system was used for each session (Version 0.1). Prior to each session, participants were sent information describing the aims and format of the session. They were also sent the URL of the project blog so as to be able to gain some background into the aims of the project. Online Appendix D lists the activities that participants were asked to undertake individually during the session. They were asked to undertake two tasks using Browse, two using Search and three using Visualise, to record their answers, and to answer a small set of questions regarding ease-of-use of the system. They were invited to add further comments if they wished. At the end of the seven tasks, participants were invited to answer a set of more general questions about the usability and usefulness of the system. Online Appendix D shows the number of participants’ answers falling into each answer category for each of the questions within the activity sheet, as well as additional comments that some of them provided about the usability and usefulness of the system.
Each session lasted approximately two hours. A member of the research team started the session by giving an overview of the aims and objectives of the project (10 minutes). A second member of the team then illustrated the Browse, Search and Visualise facilities on an overhead projector (20 minutes). The participants spent the next hour undertaking the seven activities and completing the questionnaire. The final 30 minutes comprised a group discussion to identify common themes and additional feedback for improving the system.

Discussion of results
Participants’ perceptions of the seven tasks and the accuracy of their answers are summarised in the table below:

Looking first at the results of the Browsing Tasks 1 and 2, we see that 98% of responses were in the ‘Very Easy’ or ‘Easy’ categories, which is very encouraging considering that this was participants’ first exposure to the system




Fig. 10. Number of museums opening over time.


and to the extensive concept taxonomy that is encapsulated in the Browse left-hand side menu. The percentage of fully correct answers for these tasks was 93%. Comments provided by the participants did not identify any fundamental sources of difficulty, pointing mainly to usability issues such as the font size of the left-hand-side menu entries, the need for the user to be able to see their trail of selections through these menus, window scrolling and zooming issues, and the requirement for online Help for finer details of the system’s terminology and user interface. A small number of data errors were also identified. These issues are being addressed for the final version of the system.
Looking next at the results of the Search Tasks 3 and 4, we see that overall 89% of answers were fully correct. The percentage of responses falling in the ‘Very Easy’ or ‘Easy’ categories increased from 54% in Task 3 to 64% in Task 4. These responses may reflect participants’ increasing confidence when using the Search facility as the second Search task was in fact of greater difficulty than the first. Again, comments provided by the participants did not identify any fundamental sources of difficulty, pointing mainly to similar usability issues as for Browse. Looking next at the results of the Visualise Tasks 5-7, we see that overall 82% of answers were fully correct. The percentage of responses falling in the ‘Very Easy’ or ‘Easy’ categories fell from 75% in Task 5 to 37% in Task 6 and 49% in Task 7. In parallel, the percentage of responses of ‘Mixed Feelings’ rose from 18% in Task 5 to 47% in Task




Fig. 11. Number of museums opening over time, by governance.




and 31% in Task 7. We conjecture that these responses reflect the relative difficulty of each of these tasks. None the less, the high level of overall correct answers to these tasks affirms the effectiveness of the Visualise facility. In addition to usability issues such as text placement and improving the scrolling functionality, comments provided by the participants pointed to one significant area of difficulty, namely understanding the terms appearing in the left-hand menu (which lists the different types of graphs and charts available). This feedback has led us to develop a new Help page as the home page for the Visualise facility, which describes each of the available graphs and charts and the information that they show.
Overall, participants’ levels of accuracy as they undertook the Browse, Search and Visualise tasks fell. This is understandable on a first exposure to the system, given the increasing levels of functionality and sophistication of these three facilities.
Turning now to the General Questions at the end of the activity sheet, the responses to the first five questions, which relate to the usability of the system, are summarised in the table below:




Fig. 12. Number of museum openings and closings over time.


We see that most responses to these questions fell into the ‘Very Easy’ or ‘Easy’ categories. There were 5 responses of ‘mixed feelings’ in the first question, possibly due to the issues with the menus in Browse and Visualise already highlighted above. There is a similar number of responses of ‘mixed feelings’ in the third question, possibly due to these same issues. There is also a similar number of responses of ‘mixed feelings’ in the fourth question, possibly due to the colour palette used for the line graphs in Visualise (which has been improved in subsequent versions of the system).




Fig. 13. Heatmap of Subject Matter vs Governance.



The sixth and seventh questions in the General Questions section related to participants’ perceptions of the usefulness of the system, firstly for themselves in their own role (sixth question) and secondly more broadly for other people or institutions (seventh question). For the sixth question there were 12 responses of ‘Very Useful’ or ‘Useful, and for the seventh 13 responses of ‘Very Useful’ or ‘Useful’. These responses point to the positive evaluation of the system by the majority of the study participants and its potential usefulness to a range of stakeholders. The textual comments provided by participants to the sixth and seventh questions give specific views on how the system could be used. For example:
“It would be useful to understand all museums in one area and look at accreditation status. Additionally helpful to understand dates of closure” [Cultural Heritage expert]
“Provides great statistics + trends to show development, particularly of independent museums sector - gives data for setting strategy.” [Museum Development Officer]


“understanding where to target cluster locations for training etc. E.g. if high concentration of unaccredited museums could target ‘recruitment’ drive” [Museum Accreditation Manager]
“Baseline for understanding what museums are open in research of historic loans, merged collections and ac- creditation status ... useful to know who are considered National and Accredited for potential loans/collaborations/ disposals ... could hugely support future collections management” [Cultural Heritage expert]
“Museums would like to find other museums like them and see patterns of their development over time” [Regional Museum Development Officer]
“useful to anyone wanting to understand the museum sector as this is the closest we’ve ever had to getting a full picture of it” [Senior Manager in non-governmental museum organisation].
The group discussions held at the end of each evaluation session generally repeated and reinforced the individual comments recorded within the activity sheets, as well as suggesting some further visual and interaction improvements to the user interface which we have subsequently made. Comments made during the group discussions include: “It’s easy to use, intuitive to use”, “It’s the Museum equivalent of YouTube, could lose whole evenings on it”, “Staggered by how rich the data is”, “Really interesting in terms of trends in subject matter”, “It’d be good for helping to build networks between museums. They’d begin to see where similar or complementary expertise was located”, “Could begin to build expertise around subject network groups. Often they don’t know about all the museums in their remits”, “Good that it’s not organised around county borders so you can get information on museums that are near your patch but not in it”, ”It would be very useful in advocacy when writing reports about state of play in a given area. Gives you the tools to say ‘look, it was once this but now it’s this’“, “Would be great to have more information on what happens to collections when museums close. Would be a story of survival rather than failure (.ie. the collections get passed on)”. “Very useful for AIM in terms of potential members” [AIM staff member]. “Hugely useful for the ACE” [ACE staff member]. “Great to see the whole of the UK covered. That’s really crucial to my role” [Museum Accreditation Manager]. “Would be useful for accreditation team because we could identify clusters of unaccredited museums and target them - and hold sessions in those areas” [Museum accreditation manager]. “Would be useful when you’re talking to an individual museum, because you could identify like organisations and put them in touch” [Museum Development Officer]. “I needed to know the total number of museums in London recently and couldn’t find it out. This would tell you” [ACE staff member].
Finally, one participant commented on the speed of development of the system and characterised it as being “amazing” starting from the hard-copy fragments of the core spreadsheet she had viewed less than a year before.

6	CONCLUSIONS
The Mapping Museums project aims to provide the first evidence-based history of the foundation, character and development of the museums sector between 1960 and 2020. As such, it aims to contribute to scholarly understanding of British culture, to inform policy makers, and ultimately to also be of interest to the general public. The MM project is the first to produce an authoritative database of UK museums opening and closing during a period of rapid expansion and change in the sector, covering more than double the number of venues of any previous study.
The project has adopted a participatory, rapid prototyping methodology to develop within tight scheduling and resourcing constraints a Knowledge Base to store the data and metadata of some 4,000 museums and a Web Application for the project’s humanities researchers to browse, search and visualise the data so as to investigate their research questions. The data collection, conceptual modelling, KB and Web App development, and research question elucidation and investigation have proceeded concurrently, which to our knowledge has not been addressed by any previous methodologies or works. Additional experts from the UK museums sector were involved at key points to validate the data and the new Subject Matter taxonomy, and to evaluate the KB and


Web App. Our implementation methods encompassed semantic technologies (specifically, RDF/S) to develop the KB, and metadata-driven software design, data abstraction and software introspection to develop the Web App. An evaluation study was undertaken with 15 independent domain experts from the UK museums sector. A key outcome of the study was an overall endorsement of the system. The usefulness of the system, beyond its primary aim of supporting the historical research objectives of MM project, was highlighted by researchers, consultants, accreditation officers and museums development officers. The study was also useful in identifying areas of further improvement of the user interface and the feedback received is being used to finalise the Browse, Search and Visualise facilities towards version 1.0 of the system. Another interesting outcome was identification of several potential new applications of the system, beyond the historical research objectives of the MM project, in areas such as fostering networking between similar museums, setting regional development strategy, and
targeting training for museum professionals.
The development and use of the KB and Web App has already led to insights about periods and regions showing high numbers of museum openings or closings, changes in museums’ accreditation and governance status over the past 60 years, and popular subject areas. There will now be two more years of detailed research funded by the MM project, both qualitative and quantitative, which will build on the first phase of research made possible through the development of the KB and Web App described here. Quantitative research is being conducted to establish correlations between high rates of openings or closings of museums and attributes such as accreditation, governance, location, size, and subject matter, and combinations thereof. The new attributes Geodemographic Group/Subgroup and Deprivation Index are enabling new analyses into the demographic context of museums’ openings/closings, including cross-correlation of these aspects with the other museum attributes, and hence the charting of new geographies of museums. Qualitative research is initially concentrating on the Scottish Highlands and Cornwall (regions that have seen the highest numbers of new independent museums opening) and on the East Midlands (which has seen the highest percentage growth since 1960). The project team is also examining independent museums devoted to local history, war and conflict, and transport, as these are subject areas showing some of the greatest increases in museum numbers. The qualitative research is comprising interviews at selected museums and with experts in cognate areas, and also archival research on the funding, policy, tourism and economic context of the selected locations and subject areas.
The KB development and Web App development will cease at the end of 2019 at which point they will be made publicly accessible free of charge to all users through the Mapping Museums project website36. Through the provision of the new data upload and incremental data insertion/update pipeline (discussed at the end of Section 4) the KB has the potential to continue being extended and improved through community efforts. The project website will include links to final versions of the Web App software (Version 0.2 is already freely available under Gnu General Public Licence). The KB will also be published and freely available as Linked Open Data. Moreover, since our data contains extensive hitherto unknown information on small museums, a hard copy will also be archived in the Micromuseums Archive at the Bishopsgate Institute37.
The MM project team itself has learned much from our collaboration on developing the KB and Web App described here. The computer scientists and GIScience experts were challenged by the detailed data and nuanced concepts of the humanities scholars’ evolving knowledge and understanding which needed to be captured within the KB and Web App; while the humanities scholars gained greater understanding of the techniques involved in data modelling, integration and cleansing, the role of conceptual modelling in designing specialist knowledge bases, and were prompted to devise new, more precise classificatory systems for their subject areas.
The Mapping Museums Knowledge Base is rigorously researched and has a high level of coverage and coherence. It has been designed specifically to support the historical research aims of the Mapping Museums project and so,

36www.mappingmuseums.org
37https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/


for example, does not include details of museums’ finances, accreditation history, or of museums’ collections. None the less, our adoption of Linked Data standards means that the Knowledge Base is readily extensible with additional data in a future context of additional stakeholders, requirements and funding. Moreover, due to our metadata-driven approach to developing the Web Application, this too would require little effort to encompass additional museum-centric data within its Browse, Search and Visualise Facilities. Although our KB has been developed for a specific purpose, the ontology encompassed within it represents the domain knowledge of many experts, as discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, and thus has high potential for future extension and reusability. Finally, the methodology, methods and designs presented here can provide a methodological template for other similar interdisciplinary projects aiming to create knowledge-rich resources.

How I use LLMs as a staff
engineer
Software engineers are deeply split on the subject of large language models. Many
believe they’re the most transformative technology to ever hit the industry. Others believe
they’re the latest in a long line of hype-only products: exciting to think about, but
ultimately not useful to professionals trying to do serious work.
Personally, I feel like I get a lot of value from AI. I think many of the people who don’t feel
this way are “holding it wrong”: i.e. they’re not using language models in the most helpful
ways. In this post, I’m going to list a bunch of ways I regularly use AI in my day-to-day as
a staff engineer.
Writing production code
I use Copilot completions every time I write code . Almost all the completions I accept
are complete boilerplate (filling out function arguments or types, for instance). It’s rare
that I let Copilot produce business logic for me, but it does occasionally happen. In my
areas of expertise (Ruby on Rails, for instance), I’m confident I can do better work than
the LLM. It’s just a (very good) autocomplete.
However, I’m not always working in my areas of expertise. I frequently find myself
making small tactical changes in less-familiar areas (for instance, a Golang service or a
C library). I know the syntax and have written personal projects in these languages, but
I’m less confident about what’s idiomatic. In these cases, I rely on Copilot more. Typically
I’ll use Copilot chat with the o1 model enabled, paste in my code, and ask directly “is this
idiomatic C?”
Relying more on the LLM like this is risky, because I don’t know what I’m missing. It
basically lets me operate at a smart-intern baseline across the board. I have to also
behave like a sensible intern, and make sure a subject-matter expert in the area reviews
the change for me. But even with that caveat, I think it’s very high-leverage to be able to
make these kinds of tactical changes quickly.

Writing throwaway code
I am much more liberal with my use of LLMs when I’m writing code that will never see
production. For instance, I recently did a block of research which required pulling chunks
of public data from an API, classifying it, and approximating that classification with a
series of quick regexes. All of this code was run on my laptop only, and I used LLMs to
write basically all of it: the code to pull the data, the code to run a separate LLM to
classify it, the code to tokenize it and measure token frequencies and score them, and so
on.
LLMs excel at writing code that works that doesn’t have to be maintained. Non-
production code that’s only run once (e.g. for research) is a perfect fit for this. I would say
that my use of LLMs here meant I got this done 2x-4x faster than if I’d been unassisted.
Learning new domains
Probably the most useful thing I do with LLMs is use it as a tutor-on-demand for learning
new domains. For instance, last weekend I learned the basics of Unity, relying heavily on
ChatGPT-4o. The magic of learning with LLMs is that you can ask questions: not just
“how does X work”, but follow-up questions like “how does X relate to Y”. Even more
usefully, you can ask “is this right” questions. I often write up something I think I’ve
learned and feed it back to the LLM, which points out where I’m right and where I’m still
misunderstanding. I ask the LLM a lot of questions.
I take a lot of notes when I’m learning something new. Being able to just copy-paste all
my notes in and get them reviewed by the LLM is great.
What about hallucinations? Honestly, since GPT-3.5, I haven’t noticed ChatGPT or
Claude doing a lot of hallucinating. Most of the areas I’m trying to learn about are very
well-understood (just not by me), and in my experience that means the chance of a
hallucination is pretty low. I’ve never run into a case where I learned something from a
LLM that turned out to be fundamentally wrong or hallucinated.
Last resort bug fixes
I don’t do this a lot, but sometimes when I’m really stuck on a bug, I’ll attach the entire
file or files to Copilot chat, paste the error message, and just ask “can you help?”

The reason I don’t do this is that I think I’m currently much better at bug-hunting than
current AI models. Almost all the time, Copilot (or Claude, for some personal projects)
just gets confused. But it’s still worth a try if I’m genuinely stuck, just in case, because it’s
so low-effort. I remember two or three cases where I’d just missed some subtle
behaviour that the LLM caught, saving me a lot of time.
Because LLMs aren’t that good at this yet, I don’t spend a lot of time iterating or trying to
un-stick the LLM. I just try once to see if it can get it.
Proofreading for typos and logic mistakes
I write a fair amount of English documents: ADRs, technical summaries, internal posts,
and so on. I never allow the LLM to write these for me. Part of that is that I think I can
write more clearly than current LLMs. Part of it is my general distaste for the ChatGPT
house style.
What I do occasionally do is feed a draft into the LLM and ask for feedback. LLMs are
great at catching typos, and will sometimes raise an interesting point that becomes an
edit to my draft.
Like bugfixing, I don’t iterate when I’m doing this - I just ask for one round of feedback.
Usually the LLM offers some stylistic feedback, which I always ignore.
Summary
I use LLMs for these tasks:
Smart autocomplete with Copilot
Short tactical changes in areas I don’t know well (always reviewed by a SME)
Writing lots of use-once-and-throwaway research code
Asking lots of questions to learn about new topics (e.g. the Unity game engine)
Last-resort bugfixes, just in case it can figure it out immediately
Big-picture proofreading for long-form English communication
I don’t use LLMs for these tasks (yet):

Writing whole PRs for me in areas I’m familiar with
Writing ADRs or other technical communications
Research in large codebases and finding out how things are done
1. Disclaimer: I work for GitHub, and for a year I worked directly on Copilot. Now I work
on GitHub Models.

"Lightweight Authenticated Cryptography: Balancing Security and Efficiency in Resource-Constrained Environments

The proliferation of resource-constrained devices, ranging from RFID tags and wireless sensor networks to IoT devices and embedded systems, has created a significant demand for cryptographic solutions tailored to their unique limitations. Traditional cryptographic algorithms, designed for high-performance computing environments, often prove impractical for these platforms due to their excessive computational cost, large memory footprint, and high energy consumption. This has led to the emergence of lightweight authenticated cryptography (LAC), a specialized field focused on designing cryptographic algorithms that offer both strong security and high efficiency within resource-constrained settings. The core principle of LAC is to carefully balance the trade-offs between security, performance, and resource utilization to provide effective cryptographic protection without exceeding the capabilities of the target device. This requires innovative design approaches that leverage simpler operations, minimize memory requirements, and optimize for energy efficiency, all while maintaining resistance against a wide range of cryptanalytic attacks.

Authenticated encryption (AE), the foundation of LAC, goes beyond simple confidentiality to provide both data encryption and authentication. It ensures not only that the data remains secret but also that it has not been tampered with and originates from a trusted source. This is crucial in resource-constrained environments where devices may be vulnerable to various attacks, including data injection, modification, and replay attacks. The authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) scheme further enhances this by incorporating associated data (AD), which is authenticated but not encrypted. This is particularly useful for protecting metadata or control information that must be transmitted along with the encrypted data but does not require confidentiality. The design of lightweight AEAD schemes presents a significant challenge, as they must achieve strong security against various attacks, including chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA), while remaining efficient and practical for resource-constrained devices. This often involves carefully selecting cryptographic primitives, optimizing implementation details, and employing novel architectural approaches to minimize resource overhead.

Several cryptographic primitives have emerged as promising building blocks for LAC schemes. Block ciphers, like AES, have been adapted into lightweight variants with reduced round counts or smaller block sizes. Stream ciphers, such as the ChaCha family, offer high performance and simplicity, making them suitable for hardware and software implementations on low-power devices. Hash functions, crucial for message authentication codes (MACs) and key derivation functions (KDFs), have also been redesigned with lightweight principles in mind, focusing on reducing the number of operations and memory requirements. Beyond these traditional primitives, sponge-based constructions, like Keccak (the winner of the SHA-3 competition), have gained popularity due to their inherent flexibility and ease of implementation in both hardware and software. These constructions allow for the efficient implementation of various cryptographic functionalities, including hashing, encryption, and authentication, using a single core function.

The evaluation of LAC algorithms involves a comprehensive assessment of their security, performance, and implementation characteristics. Security analysis focuses on identifying potential vulnerabilities and evaluating the algorithm's resistance against known cryptanalytic attacks, such as differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis, and algebraic attacks. Performance evaluation typically involves benchmarking the algorithm's execution speed, memory footprint, and energy consumption on different hardware platforms. Implementation characteristics, such as code size, hardware area, and power consumption, are also carefully considered to ensure that the algorithm can be practically deployed on resource-constrained devices. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has played a crucial role in standardizing LAC algorithms through its Lightweight Cryptography Project, which aims to identify and evaluate promising candidates for widespread adoption in resource-constrained environments. This standardization effort will help to ensure the interoperability and security of cryptographic solutions deployed across a wide range of devices and applications.

In conclusion, lightweight authenticated cryptography is a critical area of research and development that addresses the growing need for secure and efficient cryptographic solutions in resource-constrained environments. By carefully balancing security, performance, and resource utilization, LAC algorithms enable the secure deployment of a wide range of applications, from IoT devices and wireless sensor networks to RFID tags and embedded systems. Continued research in this field is essential to develop new and improved cryptographic primitives and schemes that can meet the ever-evolving security challenges posed by the proliferation of resource-constrained devices. The standardization efforts led by organizations like NIST will further facilitate the adoption of LAC algorithms and contribute to the development of a more secure and trustworthy ecosystem for the Internet of Things and beyond.",Other

"Proposal for the Implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Enhanced Data Governance and Collaborative Research in Genomic Sequencing

This document serves as a multi-faceted communication, addressing technical specifications, business justifications, legal considerations, academic relevance, and general public accessibility concerning the proposed implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) within the sphere of genomic sequencing. We posit that a DAO-based framework offers a superior model for data governance, collaborative research, and equitable benefit sharing compared to existing centralized systems. The core of our argument rests on the inherent transparency, immutability, and democratic nature of blockchain technology, which underpins the DAO structure. This proposal outlines the technical architecture, operational protocols, and anticipated benefits of such a system, while also addressing potential legal ramifications and ethical considerations related to data privacy and intellectual property. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the academic rigor of this approach, citing relevant literature on blockchain governance, genomic data management, and collaborative research methodologies. Finally, we will communicate this complex topic in a manner accessible to a general audience, highlighting the potential societal impact of democratized genomic research and the ethical imperative of responsible data stewardship.

The current landscape of genomic research is characterized by fragmented data silos, restricted access, and concerns over data security and privacy. Centralized databases, while offering some level of control, are vulnerable to single points of failure, data breaches, and biased decision-making. Moreover, the lack of transparency in data usage and benefit sharing hinders collaboration and impedes scientific progress. A DAO, conversely, offers a decentralized and transparent alternative. The proposed DAO will operate on a permissioned blockchain, ensuring data integrity and access control. Participants, including researchers, patients, and data providers, will be granted membership tokens, affording them voting rights on key decisions, such as data access requests, research priorities, and allocation of funding. Smart contracts will automate the execution of these decisions, ensuring impartiality and accountability. Technically, the system will leverage secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and differential privacy techniques to protect sensitive genomic data while still enabling valuable insights. This will be architected around a modular system using existing open-source tools where feasible, with custom smart contracts built using Solidity and formally verified to minimise attack surfaces. We believe this technical architecture offers a robust and scalable solution for managing the complexities of genomic data.

From a business perspective, the DAO presents a compelling model for incentivizing data sharing and accelerating scientific discovery. By creating a tokenized ecosystem, data providers can be rewarded for contributing valuable genomic information, fostering a more collaborative and inclusive research environment. Pharmaceutical companies and research institutions can leverage the DAO's data resources to develop new diagnostic tools, personalized therapies, and preventative strategies, potentially unlocking significant economic value. The increased transparency and efficiency of the DAO can also reduce administrative overhead and streamline research workflows, leading to cost savings and faster innovation cycles. A detailed financial model, including projected revenue streams, operational expenses, and potential return on investment, is included in the appendix. Furthermore, the DAO's decentralized governance structure can attract funding from a wider range of sources, including philanthropic organizations, venture capital firms, and government agencies, all aligned with the principles of open science and equitable access.

Legally, the establishment and operation of a genomic data DAO require careful consideration of existing regulations, including data privacy laws such as GDPR and HIPAA, as well as intellectual property rights. The smart contracts governing the DAO will be designed to ensure compliance with these legal frameworks, incorporating mechanisms for data anonymization, consent management, and secure data transfer. A legal opinion from a qualified expert in blockchain law and genomic data regulation has been commissioned to assess the potential legal risks and liabilities associated with the DAO. The DAO's legal structure will also need to address the issue of liability in the event of data breaches or other unforeseen events. A comprehensive legal framework, including terms of service, data usage agreements, and dispute resolution mechanisms, will be developed to mitigate these risks and protect the interests of all participants. This legal framework will be an evolving document, adapting to regulatory changes and emerging legal precedents.

Academically, the implementation of a genomic data DAO aligns with the growing body of research on blockchain governance, data science, and collaborative research methodologies. We cite existing literature that highlights the potential of DAOs to improve transparency, accountability, and efficiency in various domains. Our proposed DAO builds upon these prior studies, applying the DAO framework to the specific challenges and opportunities of genomic research. We believe that the DAO will serve as a valuable case study for researchers interested in exploring the applications of blockchain technology in healthcare and scientific research. Furthermore, the DAO will generate valuable data and insights that can be used to improve the design and implementation of future decentralized systems.

In conclusion, the proposed genomic data DAO offers a compelling vision for the future of genomic research. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more transparent, collaborative, and equitable ecosystem for data governance and scientific discovery. This DAO will be a valuable resource for researchers, patients, and the broader community, accelerating the development of new therapies and improving human health. We encourage all stakeholders to consider the potential of this transformative technology and to join us in building a more decentralized and democratic future for genomic research.",Business Proposal

"Most large employers play down the likelihood that bots will take our jobs. Then there’s
Klarna, a darling of tech investors.
Listen to this article · 19:32 min Learn more
By Noam Scheiber
Feb. 2, 2025
Ask typical corporate executives about their goals in adopting artificial intelligence, and
they will most likely make vague pronouncements about how the technology will help
employees enjoy more satisfying careers, or create as many opportunities as it
eliminates. A.I. will “help tackle the kind of tasks most people find repetitive, which frees
up employees to take on higher-value work,” Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM,
wrote in 2023.
And then there’s Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna, a Swedish tech
firm that helps consumers defer payment on purchases and that has filed paperwork to
go public in the United States with an expected valuation north of $15 billion.
Why Is This C.E.O. Bragging About
Replacing Humans With A.I.?

Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive and a co-founder of Klarna, has repeatedly
talked about how much his company has saved from using artificial intelligence tools to
automate work humans typically do. Lehtikuva/Reuters
Over the past year, Klarna and Mr. Siemiatkowski have repeatedly talked up the amount
of work they have automated using generative A.I., which serves up text, images and
videos that look like they were created by people. “I am of the opinion that A.I. can
already do all of the jobs that we, as humans, do,” he told Bloomberg News, a view that
goes far beyond what most experts claim.
According to Klarna, the company has saved the equivalent of $10 million annually using
A.I. for its marketing needs, partly by reducing its reliance on human artists to generate
images for advertising. The company said that using A.I. tools had cut back on the time
that its in-house lawyers spend generating standard contracts — to about 10 minutes
from an hour — and that its communications staff uses the technology to classify press
coverage as positive or negative. Klarna has said that the company’s chatbot does the
work of 700 customer service agents and that the bot resolves cases an average of nine
minutes faster than humans (under two minutes versus 11).
Mr. Siemiatkowski and his team went so far as to rig up an A.I. version of him to
announce the company’s third-quarter results last year — to show that even the C.E.O.’s
job isn’t safe from automation.
In interviews, Mr. Siemiatkowski has made clear he doesn’t believe the technology will
simply free up workers to focus on more interesting tasks. “People say, ‘Oh, don’t worry,
there’s going to be new jobs,’” he said on a podcast last summer, before citing the
thousands of professional translators whom A.I. is rapidly making superfluous. “I don’t
think it’s easy to say to a 55-year-old translator, ‘Don’t worry, you’re going to become a
YouTube influencer.’”
Mr. Krishna, the IBM chief executive, once turned heads when he said A.I. could prompt
the company to slow or pause hiring for the roughly 10 percent of its jobs involving back-
office roles like human resources.
For his part, Mr. Siemiatkowski said that A.I. had allowed his company to largely stop
hiring entirely as of September 2023, which he said reduced its overall head count to
under 4,000 from about 5,000. He said he expected Klarna’s work force to eventually fall
to about 2,000 as a result of its A.I. adoption. (Mr. Siemiatkowski and Klarna declined to
comment for this article.)

An A.I.-generated video of Mr. Siemiatkowski announcing the
company’s earnings last year.
One might be tempted to conclude that Mr. Siemiatkowski is simply unfamiliar with the
political sensitivity around questions of automation, or with the best practices for
communicating about it to skeptical employees. (“Leaders can combat this initial
resistance by highlighting how A.I. can help people focus on more meaningful work,” an
IBM study said.)
But Mr. Siemiatkowski is well aware of the backlash that his bluntness can provoke. “We
did a tweet later on about the marketing things we are doing about A.I., where we have
less need for photographers,” he said in the podcast interview. “That had a violent
reaction online.”
Instead, interviews with former employees and transcripts of internal company meetings
suggest that Mr. Siemiatkowski’s pronouncements about A.I. are motivated by something
altogether different from political naïveté or an impulse for real talk. And those
motivations shed light on the A.I. future that many executives and investors are working
to bring about.
Leaning In to Automation
So far, most large companies do not appear to be replacing workers en masse. A report on
50 large banks by Evident, a firm that analyzes A.I. adoption, found that they typically
derive other benefits from the technology, like improving services or helping employees
work faster.

In a paper exploring one area that Klarna has highlighted, customer service, the Stanford
economist Erik Brynjolfsson and two co-authors found that A.I. made many employees
more productive when it came to relatively complicated tasks, like navigating customers’
tax issues.
The bot did this by excelling at certain simpler tasks, like advising the human on the
optimal order in which to request information from a customer. But it didn’t handle the
interaction from start to finish. (In fairness, the experiment didn’t attempt full
automation.) “I think people exaggerate how much they can automate everything in the
near term,” said Dr. Brynjolfsson, though he acknowledged that more tasks could be
automated as A.I. became more powerful over the next few years.
When pressed, Mr. Siemiatkowski has conceded that the picture is somewhat more
complicated than his company’s news releases have suggested. He explained on another
podcast that Klarna had been relying on humans to perform customer service tasks that
other companies had automated long before A.I., like instructing a customer where to go
on the Klarna app to delay a payment. As a result, Klarna replaced more workers than
other companies would have replaced.
His claims about hiring may have been overblown, too. The website TechCrunch searched
through Klarna’s job listings more than a year after the company supposedly stopped
hiring and found more than 50 openings in a variety of jobs. A Klarna spokesman told the
outlet that the company was “not actively recruiting to expand the work force but only
backfilling some essential roles” like engineering, and that Mr. Siemiatkowski had been
“simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.”
But all of this raises the question: At a moment when A.I. is already alarming office
workers, why would a chief executive not only speak candidly about his company’s
progress in automating jobs, but even overstate the case?
A Self-Mythologizing Rise
The son of Polish nationals who immigrated to Sweden in the early 1980s, not long before
he was born, Mr. Siemiatkowski grew up feeling like something of an outsider in his
parents’ adopted country. He has talked of being teased as a child. According to former
employees, he once said that feeling like an outsider helped him empathize with Black
Americans after the killing of George Floyd.
Mr. Siemiatkowski founded Klarna, then known as Kreditor, in 2005 with two classmates
after a telemarketing job alerted him to the problems that small companies had collecting
payments from online customers. The idea was to guarantee the payment for merchants
and collect from the customer later.
It was an old retail practice known as “buy now, pay later,” except updated for the
internet age.

The company quickly turned a profit by charging merchants a fee for the payment
service, and began expanding across Europe and taking business from banks. By 2010,
Klarna had renamed itself Klarna, meaning “clear,” and had begun to attract the attention
of Silicon Valley investors.
Klarna’s offices in central Stockholm. Mr. Siemiatkowski founded Klarna in 2005 with two
classmates after he learned about the difficulties that small companies had collecting
payments from online customers. Loulou d'Aki for The New York Times
Mr. Siemiatkowski gave the impression of someone who had for years been playing out
the moment in his mind. When the famed Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia
dispatched a partner to Sweden to pitch the co-founders on an investment, telling them
Sequoia thought they could transform banking the way Google had changed the internet,
Mr. Siemiatkowski was quick to pipe up. “Just tell me one more thing,” he said, recalling
the exchange to Forbes magazine years later. “If we’re going to be the Google of banks,
would you really just send you? Wouldn’t the whole of Sequoia come here?”
The Sequoia partner quickly connected the founders with Michael Moritz, one of the
firm’s high-profile investors. Mr. Moritz apologized for not appearing in person and later
joined Klarna’s board.
Mr. Siemiatkowski, who with his strong jaw and blue eyes looks like a long-lost
Hemsworth brother, seemed to style himself as the kind of tech mogul investors were
eager to back. Former employees said the company’s hiring process for engineers
resembled that of a Silicon Valley start-up — using a logic test to screen applicants, then

requiring some to demonstrate their coding chops in real time. From Amazon, he
borrowed the “two pizza” rule — keeping teams small enough that the group could be fed
with two pizzas.
In 2019, Klarna began to build a major presence in the United States. The company’s
timing proved impeccable. When the pandemic hit, Americans cut back on dining out and
travel and embarked on an online shopping splurge — precisely the consumption habits
Klarna was built to enable.
New investors piled in at ever-higher valuations — from $5.5 billion in 2019 to $45.6
billion in 2021. Klarna accelerated hiring, roughly tripling in size to 7,000 employees
within three years. It ran a Super Bowl ad starring Maya Rudolph to lodge itself in the
American psyche.
Then the bill came due. From Google to Amazon to Netflix, the share prices of companies
that had raked in profits as people retreated to their living rooms were suddenly
pummeled by investors who saw rising inflation and interest rates as a sign that the
pandemic-era boom was ending.
When Klarna tried to raise money again in 2022, reportedly seeking a valuation above
$50 billion, investors had other ideas. A funding round announced in July would value it at
a mere $6.7 billion.
In the meantime, Klarna culled about 10 percent of its employees, under pressure from
investors to cut costs, and endured suddenly skeptical media coverage.
Mr. Siemiatkowski also now had to contend with another setback to his rise as a tech
icon: a growing union presence inside the company.

Though morale at Klarna had generally been high because of its collaborative culture and
competitive pay, a relatively small group of workers had formed a union in 2020. The
union roughly doubled in size, to over 1,000 employees, not long after the downsizing
announcement in May 2022.
During an all-hands meeting around the same time, a recording of which The New York
Times obtained, Mr. Siemiatkowski spoke darkly of how unionized companies handle
layoffs (“union representatives and senior management, behind locked doors, decide on
the outcome of each individual”).
He seemed to worry that a union would turn Klarna into just another stodgy Swedish
company — around 90 percent of the country’s workers are covered by collective-
bargaining agreements — and hardly the muse of investors worldwide. “The more
everything becomes thick and slow moving,” he said at another meeting, alluding to the
effect of a union, “my investors will challenge me.”
But as workers prepared to strike in the fall of 2023, the company backed down and
signed a collective-bargaining agreement.
Mr. Siemiatkowski was sarcastic and brooding as he announced the arrangement at a
third all-hands meeting. He appeared to liken union leaders to the pigs in “Animal Farm,”
whom George Orwell had intended as a stand-in for Stalinists, and he quipped that there
were two people in the entire company of more than 4,000 who made less than what the
collective-bargaining agreement would mandate. “They’re going to get a salary increase
thanks to us signing the C.B.A.,” he said. “Isn’t that amazing?”
A Favorite Guinea Pig
Mr. Siemiatkowski often says he first realized A.I. would upend the workaday world
shortly after playing around with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022, only a few months after
Klarna endured layoffs and saw its valuation crater. “I’m on Twitter in November ’22, and
somebody is tweeting, ‘You’ve got to try this,’” he said on a podcast. “I’m just like, ‘Jesus,
I’m speaking to a computer.’”
He quickly arranged a meeting with Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, and
began pushing employees to experiment with the software.

be “their favorite guinea pig.” Jeenah Moon for The New York Times
Whatever progress Klarna made on automation, Mr. Siemiatkowski sometimes seemed
as invested in spinning out a story about A.I. as actually using the technology. In 2024, he
and the company regularly put out news releases and conducted interviews, leading to
headlines like “Klarna Marketing Chief Says A.I. Is Helping It Become ‘Brutally
Efficient,’” in The Wall Street Journal.
By the time Mr. Siemiatkowski made the rounds of prominent tech podcasts that summer,
in a tour that included the popular show “Acquired” and podcasts hosted by Sequoia and
the venture capitalist Logan Bartlett, he seemed to have distilled Klarna’s A.I. story to its
sharpest narrative elements.
“My understanding is that you told Sam and OpenAI that you wanted to be their guinea
pig,” an interviewer said.
“Their favorite guinea pig,” Mr. Siemiatkowski corrected.
A former Klarna manager, who left in 2022, said the rhetorical emphasis on A.I. was no
accident. According to the manager, there was a sense within the company that Klarna
had lost its sheen in the media and among investors, and that Mr. Siemiatkowski was

desperate to get it back.
Klarna’s likely public offering is one of the more anticipated of this year, and although some
of that reflects the company’s improved financial performance, Mr. Siemiatkowski’s
relentless focus on A.I. appears to have been important. Loulou d'Aki for The New York Times
The former manager said the A.I. story provided a lifeline at a time when Klarna was
hoping to offer shares on the public markets. It demonstrated that the company was still
on the cutting edge, and that it was shrinking not because it had faltered but because it
had figured out how to replace humans with machines.
The effort appears to have worked. Klarna’s likely public offering is one of the more
anticipated of this year and could fetch triple the valuation that followed its 2022 swoon.
Though some of that progress reflects Klarna’s improved financial performance over the
past year and a half and the upward march of the market overall, Mr. Siemiatkowski’s
relentless focus on A.I. appears to have been important. “The benefits of A.I. are likely to
be a key selling point for any Klarna I.P.O.,” The Financial Times wrote last year.
It does not appear to have hurt that Mr. Siemiatkowski is willing to go much further in his
A.I. pronouncements than fellow C.E.O.s, telling the paper, “Not only can we do more with
less, but we can do much more with less.”
Mr. Siemiatkowski’s statements are sometimes sweeping or grandiose because, former
employees say, he sees himself as a righteous warrior in a fight with powerful forces. “I
have always been anti-establishment,” he said at one all-hands meeting. “To me, what
we’ve been doing here, going after the banks, is to be anti-establishment.”

As with his challenge to Swedish banks and his standoff with the union, Mr.
Siemiatkowski’s A.I. campaign appears to be another instance of self-interest merging
with heroic self-conception.
When the host of the “Big Technology Podcast” asked why he was so intent on talking up
Klarna’s A.I. prowess, Mr. Siemiatkowski said it was partly for the good of humanity.
“We have a moral responsibility to share that we are actually seeing real results and that
that’s actually having implications on society today,” he said. “To encourage people,
specifically politicians in society, to actually treating this as a serious change that’s
coming.”
Then he acknowledged that another part of the motivation was “self-promotion, for sure.”
He added, “We’re regarded as a thought leader.”
Saying What Investors Can’t
Mr. Siemiatkowski may have at times overstated what A.I. has accomplished at Klarna,
but that doesn’t mean he’s wrong about the future.
Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford economist, said that he thought “people exaggerate how much
they can automate everything in the near term,” though he acknowledged that more tasks
could be automated as A.I. became more powerful in the future. Yves Herman/Reuters
Dr. Brynjolfsson of Stanford notes that most office jobs are collections of tasks, and that
while A.I. can take on some of them, it still struggles to combine most or all of them in the
manner of a human.

But even he believes that could change within a few years, while a growing number of
tech experts argue that artificial general intelligence — a bot that can do anything the
human brain does — is not far-off. Mr. Altman of OpenAI recently predicted that A.I.
agents — bots than can perform relatively complicated tasks on their own— would soon
“join the work force” and “materially change the output of companies.” Others have
predicted that such agents will take over a wide variety of jobs.
Many tech investors are already banking on this outcome, effectively counting on
automation to save their huge bets on free-spending A.I companies. In an influential
analysis last year, the venture capitalist David Cahn estimated that the combined A.I.-
related revenue of companies like OpenAI and Microsoft was likely to be hundreds of
billions a year less than the amount needed to pay back investors.
But one way to make the numbers add up is if employers can save hundreds of billions of
dollars using A.I. to replace workers in the relatively near future. In that case, the
revenue of companies like OpenAI could grow rapidly and their investors could earn a
profit. (They might still risk being undercut by Chinese competitors who can build similar
technology at lower cost, though that would also make it cheaper for employers to
automate work.)
The catch is that very few investors and top executives are willing to discuss this in plain
language. When it comes to the question of job loss, those with a large financial interest in
A.I. tend to euphemize and equivocate.
Even Mr. Altman, one of the foremost proponents of the idea that A.I. will soon be capable
of advanced humanlike cognition, has increasingly avoided discussing the potential
downside for workers. Two years ago, he conceded that A.I. would take over certain jobs
and that the shift in power from labor to capital “goes way further in a world with A.I.” By
last year, he had toned down this language, telling a podcaster that he, too, imagined A.I.
taking over tasks rather than whole jobs and that it would allow people to do work at “a
higher level of abstraction.” He did this even as — or perhaps because — he seemed to
think the technology was becoming vastly more powerful.
(OpenAI declined to comment. The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner,
Microsoft, for copyright infringement. The two tech companies have denied the claims.)
Mr. Siemiatkowski has brought clarity to this discussion. In his eagerness to court
investors, and in his tendency to overstate the case and say the quiet part out loud, he has
laid bare Silicon Valley’s ambition. In his own slightly muddled way, for his own slightly
idiosyncratic reasons, he is helping to surface a conversation that has largely been
whispered in the executive suites.
Investors in his presence sometimes become so excited about the possibilities of
displacing humans that they forget to deploy the usual euphemisms and aphorisms.
During a podcast interview with Mr. Siemiatkowski, a partner at the prominent venture

firm Kleiner Perkins gushed about Klarna’s “full-on automation at scale” and said, “That’s
where it’s eyebrow-raising.”
At times, even Mr. Siemiatkowski can be wrong-footed by such directness. When another
podcaster asked which jobs were most likely to be automated, he seemed momentarily
flustered, then reached for a joke he’d told Sam Altman.
“I said to Sam, ‘What you should focus on, try to build A.I. that replaces C.E.O.s, bankers
and lawyers,’” he recalled, identifying three unpopular jobs. “‘Nobody will make a big fuss
about it.’”

Ask typical corporate executives about their goals in adopting artificial intelligence, and they will most likely make vague pronouncements about how the technology will help employees enjoy more satisfying careers, or create as many opportunities as it eliminates. A.I. will “help tackle the kind of tasks most people find repetitive, which frees up employees to take on higher-value work,” Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, wrote in 2023.
And then there’s Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna, a Swedish tech firm that helps consumers defer payment on purchases and that has filed paperwork to go public in the United States with an expected valuation north of $15 billion.

Over the past year, Klarna and Mr. Siemiatkowski have repeatedly talked up the amount of work they have automated using generative A.I., which serves up text, images and videos that look like they were created by people. “I am of the opinion that A.I. can already do all of the jobs that we, as humans, do,” he told Bloomberg News, a view that goes far beyond what most experts claim.
According to Klarna, the company has saved the equivalent of $10 million annually using A.I. for its marketing needs, partly by reducing its reliance on human artists to generate images for advertising. The company said that using A.I. tools had cut back on the time that its in-house lawyers spend generating standard contracts — to about 10 minutes from an hour — and that its communications staff uses the technology to classify press coverage as positive or negative. Klarna has said that the company’s chatbot does the work of 700 customer service agents and that the bot resolves cases an average of nine minutes faster than humans (under two minutes versus 11).
Mr. Siemiatkowski and his team went so far as to rig up an A.I. version of him to announce the company’s third-quarter results last year — to show that even the C.E.O.’s job isn’t safe from automation.
In interviews, Mr. Siemiatkowski has made clear he doesn’t believe the technology will simply free up workers to focus on more interesting tasks. “People say, ‘Oh, don’t worry, there’s going to be new jobs,’” he said on a podcast last summer, before citing the thousands of professional translators whom A.I. is rapidly making superfluous. “I don’t think it’s easy to say to a 55-year-old translator, ‘Don’t worry, you’re going to become a YouTube influencer.’”
Mr. Krishna, the IBM chief executive, once turned heads when he said A.I. could prompt the company to slow or pause hiring for the roughly 10 percent of its jobs involving back-office roles like human resources.

For his part, Mr. Siemiatkowski said that A.I. had allowed his company to largely stop hiring entirely as of September 2023, which he said reduced its overall head count to under 4,000 from about 5,000. He said he expected Klarna’s work force to eventually fall to about 2,000 as a result of its A.I. adoption. (Mr. Siemiatkowski and Klarna declined to comment for this article.)
Image

An A.I.-generated video of Mr. Siemiatkowski announcing the company’s earnings last year.
One might be tempted to conclude that Mr. Siemiatkowski is simply unfamiliar with the political sensitivity around questions of automation, or with the best practices for communicating about it to skeptical employees. (“Leaders can combat this initial resistance by highlighting how A.I. can help people focus on more meaningful work,” an IBM study said.)
But Mr. Siemiatkowski is well aware of the backlash that his bluntness can provoke. “We did a tweet later on about the marketing things we are doing about A.I., where we have less need for photographers,” he said in the podcast interview. “That had a violent reaction online.”
Instead, interviews with former employees and transcripts of internal company meetings suggest that Mr. Siemiatkowski’s pronouncements about A.I. are motivated by something altogether different from political naïveté or an impulse for real talk. And those motivations shed light on the A.I. future that many executives and investors are working to bring about.
Leaning In to Automation
So far, most large companies do not appear to be replacing workers en masse. A report on 50 large banks by Evident, a firm that analyzes A.I. adoption, found that they typically derive other benefits from the technology, like improving services or helping employees work faster.
In a paper exploring one area that Klarna has highlighted, customer service, the Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson and two co-authors found that A.I. made many employees more productive when it came to relatively complicated tasks, like navigating customers’ tax issues.
The bot did this by excelling at certain simpler tasks, like advising the human on the optimal order in which to request information from a customer. But it didn’t handle the interaction from start to finish. (In fairness, the experiment didn’t attempt full automation.) “I think people exaggerate how much they can automate everything in the near term,” said Dr. Brynjolfsson, though he acknowledged that more tasks could be automated as A.I. became more powerful over the next few years.
When pressed, Mr. Siemiatkowski has conceded that the picture is somewhat more complicated than his company’s news releases have suggested. He explained on another podcast that Klarna had been relying on humans to perform customer service tasks that other companies had automated long before A.I., like instructing a customer where to go on the Klarna app to delay a payment. As a result, Klarna replaced more workers than other companies would have replaced.
His claims about hiring may have been overblown, too. The website TechCrunch searched through Klarna’s job listings more than a year after the company supposedly stopped hiring and found more than 50 openings in a variety of jobs. A Klarna spokesman told the outlet that the company was “not actively recruiting to expand the work force but only backfilling some essential roles” like engineering, and that Mr. Siemiatkowski had been “simplifying for brevity in a broadcast interview.”
But all of this raises the question: At a moment when A.I. is already alarming office workers, why would a chief executive not only speak candidly about his company’s progress in automating jobs, but even overstate the case?
A Self-Mythologizing Rise
The son of Polish nationals who immigrated to Sweden in the early 1980s, not long before he was born, Mr. Siemiatkowski grew up feeling like something of an outsider in his parents’ adopted country. He has talked of being teased as a child. According to former employees, he once said that feeling like an outsider helped him empathize with Black Americans after the killing of George Floyd.
Mr. Siemiatkowski founded Klarna, then known as Kreditor, in 2005 with two classmates after a telemarketing job alerted him to the problems that small companies had collecting payments from online customers. The idea was to guarantee the payment for merchants and collect from the customer later.
It was an old retail practice known as “buy now, pay later,” except updated for the internet age.
The company quickly turned a profit by charging merchants a fee for the payment service, and began expanding across Europe and taking business from banks. By 2010, Klarna had renamed itself Klarna, meaning “clear,” and had begun to attract the attention of Silicon Valley investors.

Mr. Siemiatkowski gave the impression of someone who had for years been playing out the moment in his mind. When the famed Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia dispatched a partner to Sweden to pitch the co-founders on an investment, telling them Sequoia thought they could transform banking the way Google had changed the internet, Mr. Siemiatkowski was quick to pipe up. “Just tell me one more thing,” he said, recalling the exchange to Forbes magazine years later. “If we’re going to be the Google of banks, would you really just send you? Wouldn’t the whole of Sequoia come here?”
The Sequoia partner quickly connected the founders with Michael Moritz, one of the firm’s high-profile investors. Mr. Moritz apologized for not appearing in person and later joined Klarna’s board.
Mr. Siemiatkowski, who with his strong jaw and blue eyes looks like a long-lost Hemsworth brother, seemed to style himself as the kind of tech mogul investors were eager to back. Former employees said the company’s hiring process for engineers resembled that of a Silicon Valley start-up — using a logic test to screen applicants, then requiring some to demonstrate their coding chops in real time. From Amazon, he borrowed the “two pizza” rule — keeping teams small enough that the group could be fed with two pizzas.
In 2019, Klarna began to build a major presence in the United States. The company’s timing proved impeccable. When the pandemic hit, Americans cut back on dining out and travel and embarked on an online shopping splurge — precisely the consumption habits Klarna was built to enable.
New investors piled in at ever-higher valuations — from $5.5 billion in 2019 to $45.6 billion in 2021. Klarna accelerated hiring, roughly tripling in size to 7,000 employees within three years. It ran a Super Bowl ad starring Maya Rudolph to lodge itself in the American psyche.
Then the bill came due. From Google to Amazon to Netflix, the share prices of companies that had raked in profits as people retreated to their living rooms were suddenly pummeled by investors who saw rising inflation and interest rates as a sign that the pandemic-era boom was ending.
When Klarna tried to raise money again in 2022, reportedly seeking a valuation above $50 billion, investors had other ideas. A funding round announced in July would value it at a mere $6.7 billion.
In the meantime, Klarna culled about 10 percent of its employees, under pressure from investors to cut costs, and endured suddenly skeptical media coverage.
Mr. Siemiatkowski also now had to contend with another setback to his rise as a tech icon: a growing union presence inside the company.

But as workers prepared to strike in the fall of 2023, the company backed down and signed a collective-bargaining agreement.
Mr. Siemiatkowski was sarcastic and brooding as he announced the arrangement at a third all-hands meeting. He appeared to liken union leaders to the pigs in “Animal Farm,” whom George Orwell had intended as a stand-in for Stalinists, and he quipped that there were two people in the entire company of more than 4,000 who made less than what the collective-bargaining agreement would mandate. “They’re going to get a salary increase thanks to us signing the C.B.A.,” he said. “Isn’t that amazing?”
